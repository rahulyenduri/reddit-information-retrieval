Google expects the commute to take 40 minutes. Dart takes 25 minutes longer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, suppose you wanted to improve travel times for commuters. Ask the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDot) to bring travel time improvements to commuters and what do you think they would tell you to do?\n\nTxDot would probably propose freeway widening projects that cost hundreds of millions (maybe even a billion or more), that would destroy lots of homes and businesses that are in the way. The wider roads would devalue adjacent properties due the added noise and air pollution. TxDot's own projections would probably only project a few minutes in travel time savings. You need a tremendous amount of effort for these marginal improvements in travel time, while also worsening the quality of life for the neighborhoods the freeway cuts through. You'd need years of construction, lots of studies, lots of money, lots of engineering, planning, and eminent domain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMeanwhile, on public transit, this trip takes just over an hour. 25% of that time is spent waiting on a bus.\n\nIf you simply make the buses and the trains run more often, you reduce the average wait time for passengers. Thats it, thats all you have to do. No eminent domain, no capital spending, no billion dollar projects.\n\nSimply running more buses and trains per hour could almost immediately save commuters up to an hour of travel time (more realistically, 15-30 minutes each way)\n\nThere does not exist a way to save car commuters 30 minutes of time per day for so little cost, and so little effort, within a short period of time. You'd need to spend hundreds of millions minimum to make a temporary dent in these travel times.\n\nIf you improve these transit travel times, you might just get more people choosing to take the bus/train, making for less traffic, thus improving travel time for drivers too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are other cheap ways to improve bus travel speeds as well (giving buses signal priority at traffic lights, bus stop consolidation, queue jumps, etc) but you don't even need to go there to get massive travel time improvements.\n\nIf widening highways was the key to fixing traffic, then we probably would have solved traffic by now with how massive they have gotten in Dallas.\n\nInvestments in transit are the way to go, and we have enough low cost high reward low hanging fruit that would actually get a lot more people choosing to take the bus.",

                "body": "My commute by car from my front door in Northern/Central Carrollton is normally about 25 to 30 minutes to the parking garage in Downtown Dallas. I would commute four to five times a week for over a year by car, and it happened less than three times that my commute took longer. The train takes about 45 minutes from the moment it leaves North Carrollton/Frankford Station, the closest station to my home, to Akard Station, the closest station to my work. I will concede that the drive back home can be up to 45 minutes, in my experience, but it wasn't uncommon for it to be 25 minutes, depending on when I got off.\n\nEven if I have to park at the very top of my parking garage and walk to my work, it is a wash. This isn't even considering the commute from my home to the train station because GoLink (or Ubers ordered by GoLink when the only driver they have hired per shift and overwork) which is another ~8 minute drive and the negligible walk from Akard to work.\n\nOn top of that, it has taken up to thirty minutes before for GoLink or the Uber to even get to me, but I can not order while I am getting ready because it might only be three minutes away. And, yes, I have pre-set my ride hours in advance before, but I still had to wait over ten minutes past for a driver to get to me. And then, of course, I have to tip for what is being marketed as public transportation. I mean, I don't have to, but I also don't want to be a douchebag.\n\nThere used to be a predictable and reliable bus line three minutes walk from my front door, but they decided to get rid of it, and, now, the closest bus stop, iirc, is a fifteen minute walk.\n\nI would like to note that if PT was key to commute times, then cities with much better PT in the US would have better commute times, but most do not, when compared to DFW. The problem with this \"issue\" is people living forty miles from work, driving, and making other people's commutes worse, on top of that. Unlike most people, even after years of driving, I love my commute, either way. If I drive, I can listen to some music and sing karaoke, or, on DART (which is the only way I commute now), I can play games on my phone or read a book.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love DART. My comments in the past have always been supportive. I always push for my friends and coworkers to use it. Most things equal, I purposely shop in member cities over non-member cities because of the sales tax. My experience with commute times just doesn't match watch you are saying.\n\nHonestly, I think if my issue was time, the best way to cut down on commute times on DART would be to increase speed and/or cut down on stops, which obviously has other issues.",

Someone in Manhattan is not going to be able to commute as many miles in 30 minutes as someone in, way, Frisco. If distance someone can commute is your metric, Manhattan does a poor job.\n\nHowever, the number of jobs that person has access to within 30 minutes of their home is going to exceed that of a DFW resident, potentially by orders of magnitude (wish I had these numbers)\n\n\nI'd also like to point out that even if driving is faster, improving commute times (particularly on the congested downtown free way loop) would be extremely difficult and expensive, and likely not yield much benefit. Yet, someone who waits 30 minutes each way for GoLink? You could easily cut down their time commuting by 20 minutes per day with a better bus network. How could you give a driver 20 minutes of travel time savings for so little relative cost? I don't think it's possible",

Unless something seriously insane happens, someone in Manhatten will always have more jobs within thirty minutes than someone in most parts of DFW.\n\nAnother thing, I work at a bar. I cannot rely on DART to go home after work. I am a bit bitter that DART basically said restaurant and bar workers are not part of their demographic and decided to close from one to four in the morning. If by increasing frequency, you also mean making tge system 24 hours, I completely agree.",

Using separate cars like this also allows us to reduce size from 2 cars to 1 when rush hour ends, so we're able to send cars to the shop for maintenance without interrupting service.\u00a0\n\n\nHaving said all that, the company is indeed looking at what are called 'pass through cars for the fleet update that will be coming up in the next few years. Basically, it will be exactly what you said: one long car, but with segments we can add or remove to change the train length to suit our needs. The one downside is that cuts and additions would need to be done in our yards, rather than on the mainline, but it should increase capacity by quite a bit.",

But that wasn't quite what happened; it was a DART transport minivan that came to get me ten minutes later, So, all told, I waited between fifteen and twenty minutes for service. \n\nThere was one other passenger in the minivan, but she was also going to downtown Rowlett station to catch a train. So I had a direct point-to-point ride, \n\nGot to Rowlett station; train was leaving four minutes later, si I just jumped on. I'm an hour early for work, but that could have easily been 40 minutes had I taken a later train. \n\nI am awfully critical of DART much of the time, always over rail service (my commute involves no buses). The GoLink service went really well for me this morning, although my train was delayed **four times.** \n\nNow, it's just a question of when to schedule a ride home. I figure I'll try and do it as my train pulls out of Garland; that would amount to about a ten minute delay between requesting the service and receiving it, \n\nBesides, the ride home is a lot less stressful than the ride to work!",

Y\u2019all\u2019s tips really helped me navigate my route and made it much less nerve racking. When I got my job I knew I would have to use dart before I got my car and finding dallasurbanists on TikTok and instagram and finding this subreddit really ignited the urbanist feelings I\u2019ve had. While Dallas is by no means a truly walkable city having dart gives me the wiggle room I needed for this in between before I get my car, the thought of me having to drain my paychecks using Uber before I decided to use dart gives me a huge sigh of relief.

I bought a folding Brompton bike which is ideal for multi modal commutes. It folds small to sit under a desk at work or at a coffee shop, and it easily fits in any car trunk or even on the Golink bus. Because it goes everywhere with you, you don\u2019t need to lock it or leave it out of sight. They are super popular in large cities like London (country of origin), New York and Barcelona\u2026 I see the rare one around Dallas from time to time. You can get them at REI or Bike Mart, or order them from Portapedal.com as I did. \n\nWith a folding bike (Brompton specifically since the fold is smaller and better than the others), you might be able to prolong a car purchase. I live in Richardson and I am able to use the bike + train for 80% of my trips. We got rid of our second car after realizing we hardly used it. Bromptons are not cheap, but they are equivalent to only a couple of car payments. Cars are vastly more expensive to own and drive. \n\nIt is a rarity to be car free (or car \u201clite\u201d) in DFW, but living here doesn\u2019t  have to mean automatically defaulting to a car.

                "body": "Former light rail operator here.\n\nFirst off, are you at least 21? You have to be that old to be an operator. I'm not saying DART won't hire you, because I know a guy who got hired on at 18, but as soon as the word got out that he was \"underage\", they removed him from the training, told him they were going to move him to another job at DART, and ghosted him. Extremely unprofessional, as is so many other things at DART.\n\nPay after training depends on what the full rate is, and changes each year. The union sets a pay rate each year, and everyone who has been there five or more years gets that rate. If you're in your first year, you get 75%. Second year gets you 80%, and so on and so forth. You get the raise on the first pay period (biweekly pay) after your seniority date. I don't know what the current pay rate is, so hopefully a current operator can help you.\n\nDART isn't getting automated anytime soon. Don't sweat it.\n\nI hate to say this because I am very pro union and pro worker's rights, but the union is absolutely trash and is corrupt as hell. I would not pay into it if I went back. You'll still get all of the same benefits without losing $60ish per month to a bunch of rats. They routinely allowed contract violations because it would help out a buddy, whether it was management or rank and file. Trying to look for answers in the contract was useless, because if I pointed out an issue, they'd return with a crumpled up \"supplemental agreement\" specific to my issue that looked like it had been Xeroxed and faxed about a dozen times each.\n\nFurthermore, the union continues to uphold a policy that allows operators to transfer seniority from the bus division to the rail division. If a bus operator with more seniority than you transfers over and finishes class, your seniority goes *down*. It's fucking ridiculous, and if you dare to question it, you'll be bullied relentlessly. Amalgamated Transit Union local 1338 is, by and far, the WORST union I've ever been involved with and I'm mad at myself for having such good faith in them when I first started.\n\nUpward mobility at DART is possible, but there is a *heavy* scent of nepotism in the air. This is another thing I don't say lightly because it sounds like boomer bullshit, but the lighter your skin is, the less likely you are to get a job. I'm not even kidding when I say that I didn't get the job until I got pissed off one night after getting a hundred rejection letters from them and identified as black on the application.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't recommend the job for anything besides pay and benefits. The trains suck, the assholes that get on the train suck, the management is incompetent, and the DART Police are actively avoiding their jobs at all times. I worked there for four and a half years before I got a better job.",

I understand how you could come to that interpretation. \n\nDo you mind if I ask you about where you went after? Was it transportation adjacent or was it something completely different? I\u2019m just stuck and want something for my beautiful fianc\u00e9 and the kids we hope to have soon.",

                "body": "I'm late to the party here, but I'm a current rail operator.\u00a0 The issues already laid out are a thing, but it does depend a little on your perspective. More people of color get promoted, sure, but us white guys are a very large minority at the company, too. I can't speak to initial hire practices, as I got hired on my first application and I'm white as the new fallen snow, but I won't say others' experiences aren't different.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe union is... I donno. It's there. New leadership has just been voted in, but there definitely is a defeatist attitude under everything; \"We don't have the right to strike, so we have no real power.\" They fight for raises every year, but they don't take any big swings. They need to be pushing for guaranteed right to strike, 4 day weeks, hazard pay, that sort of thing. Maybe the new brass will. As for the shared seniority with the bus side, they have a freeze on transfers for the moment, which doesn't show any signs of letting up any time soon.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nCompany management has also changed in the last 18 months. I wish I could say it was for the better, but they've made it clear that they don't care what the operators concerns are, and that they don't trust us to operate correctly. They're also big fans of collective punishment... for instance, somebody passed a red signal one time, and now we all have to radio in for permission to pass that signal, even when it's green. It helps the new operators and keeps the lazy operators in check, but it's a real hindrance to those of us who don't make those kinds of mistakes.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nOk. All the negativity put aside. I have worked some dog shit jobs in my day. This one is not on that list. Sure, the passengers can be obnoxious and there are a ton of homeless people, but that's just a problem with public transit in general. It doesn't really bother me. If you're a person that might find that irritating, then maybe you won't like the job, but if not, it's great. You're locked in a box all day, and nobody bothers you. And if you stay off the radio unless absolutely necessary, then the days pass quickly and quietly.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThis is a job where you get what you give. If you show up on time, don't call out, and follow the rules and regulations, then you'll find success here. Your first few years will suck because of the seniority system- you'll be working nights, weekends, and holidays for at least 2-3 years. Edit: after 2-3 years, you'll have slightly more control of your days off and shift, but you won't consistently be able to get weekends off for 6-7 years MINIMUM, and more like 10+; you won't get holidays off unless it's your regular day off for 15+. You'll be getting off late enough that you can't go to the bars after work, and even if you could, this is not a job you can do hung over on 4 hours of sleep.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThis job though, it's paid for a house and a car, I've had no trouble getting all the time I need for medical procedures for me or my partner, they have overtime when you want it, and most of the people who work here are awesome. The pay is pretty good, the benefits aren't bad, and most of the leadership you deal with directly on the day to day are great.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nIf it's something you seriously want to get in to, keep your eye on the job board. We're short operators, so they'll be hiring again any time now if they aren't already.",

After that it goes up around $1.50 per year until you hit the salary cap on your fifth anniversary.\u00a0\n\n\nWe also usually get a cost of living bump every year. Some years it's better than others, but I'd imagine the cap will be 35 by the time 2024 students reach it.\n\n\nOn top of that, most runs have overtime built in, and there's basically always extra work for those willing.",

It's a good way to still bring benefits to riders, and boost ridership where you can, retain customers. \n\nBut I think it's clear that the entire 229 route can justify more frequent service, it's a very popular route.

                "body": "Before I get into this, I want to clarify that we are talking about how busy the route is, not how high the ridership is. A very long, frequent route with 800 daily riders would not be considered as busy as a short infrequent routes with 700 riders, for example. \n\nSo with that in mind,\n\nIt's probably never going to happen. The 883 is unbelievably busy, both the east and West routes. There are going to be more alternatives for getting from the light rail system to UTD, that's very true. It doesn't matter much though, because I'm pretty sure a minority of 883 east riders are connecting to the light rail. \n\nThere are a lot of other factors contributing to the routes success\n\n1. Transit dependent population. Lots of students just don't have a license yet or can't afford a car, or need to save money. International students are usually going to need a bus as well, they often come from less car dependent places to begin with and even if they own a car they can't take it with them. They pay a lot of money for school as well, not having subsidized tuition. And the 883 serves them pretty well, frequent service to your main reason for being here (school),  takes you to the shops off coit and Campbell, and can connect you to the light rail system. There's also other DART services nearby like the 232, 240, and 241. This means a student who is not only forced to take public transit can also have their needs met, and they can probably get to their internship too.\n\n2. People who drive to UTD actually have to pay for the space they occupy and the infrastructure that's required to serve them (parking garages, lots, etc). This provides incentives to take a bus that most destinations do not have. And, finding parking close to your classes is annoying. There is always capacity, but it's not always a short walk. The 883 stops you off right at the front of campus, so if you lived on the apartments off coit and had a car, the 883 is still going to be the more convenient option.\n\n3. The route is free. Well, UTD pays for it, but still, free riders always increase ridership. That being said, any UTD student can get free DART passes, so even if the 883 did charge fare it may have a negligible impact, and more students would probably just sign up for the DART fare program. For UTD, it's probably waaaay cheaper to pay for the bus fares than it is to provide every student parking (and this ignores the fact that not every student can even drive)\n\n\nThat doesn't mean the 883 is always the busiest though. On a Sunday, the route 22 may actually be busier than the 883 as students don't need to go to class and the 883 has less service on Sunday. And during winter break for example, the 883 is not going to be very busy.  But overall, it will probably never be dethroned.\n\nThe route 239 is what you might call the busiest route that isn't the 883. It's ridership is not the highest, tons of routes have higher ridership. But the 239 is the most \"full\", it serves more passenger miles for every mile driven than any other DART bus route. \n\nOr you could say the route 13 is the busiest non UTD route. For every hour in revenue service, a bus driving the route 13 route carries 21 people. That is to say, for every hour of labor spent on this route you get 21 passengers on average. Pretty good. For the 883 though, this number is 37 on average. Oh and these numbers I'm pulling, comes from the months of April, May, and June. Summer starts in May, so even WITH summer bringing down the average and the 883 still smokes the competition. \n\nSo on a month like October? I don't think any of the routes stand a chance\n\nNow certain sections of route may get pretty close. I know the route 22 between forest/jupiter and Forest Lane station gets really busy. But as it stands right now I don't think any route is even close to passing it up except during times where UTD students are away from UTD",

If you look at the future DART plans, you will see that this will be remedied.\n\nAnother reason, is that the orange line is the newest line. You could argue the other lines have had time for locals to learn about the service, and try it out. The other lines have also had time for development to spring up near the stations. That is only just now happening with the orange line. \n\nLas Colinas also suffers from job sprawl. It's not a very easy place to serve by transit, lots of major activity centers spread out. It's very car oriented, and poorly designed.",

That being said I don't think it's performance is mind-blowing either. Same for the 249, They serve the areas between mockingbird and CBD. \n\nThe route 9 and 23 are definitely the best ridership routes in that neighborhood though. It's very dense and pretty walkable by Dallas standards. Lots of high income housing though. \n\nThe 209 serves Knox Henderson, and duplicates the M-line trolley route. This is a really bad performer, maybe even the worst performing bus route. Knox Henderson deserves good transit,  but the M-line cannibalizes the ridership on the 209. But the m-line doesn't serve Knox Henderson, so it's a bit of an awkward situation.\n\nThe route 105 fills in the gaps, but is a low performer due to the fact that sections of the route are close to other DART services (well that's one theory anyways)",

        "selftext": "If you don't care to see the summary of this DART presentation I put together (and I added my own thoughts), scroll down to the bottom of this post, I linked the presentation where this is talked about in greater detail.  \n\n\nA while back, DART and Mesquite worked on a service plan, and DART drew up various maps, showing us what transit in Mesquite might look like.\n\n  \nFirst, this was a scenario where Mesquite's bus network is independent and doesn't connect as well into Garland, East Dallas, and Pleasant Grove  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5bevrrwrtd7c1.png?width=394&format=png&auto=webp&s=90c01124d7276532b96cacce15d9a705038ab6d7\n\nThey expected the route 1 (that purple route on the east that makes those weird deviations) to be the highest ridership. I like the express route to town east mall, I think this would be a pretty good network. There are a lot of deviations though, which is to be expected for a city like Mesquite.  \n\n\nCloser look at the routes:  \n\n\n  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xf9afi95ud7c1.png?width=763&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f88c6d5475b0614119ba44975e785b92b2d9198\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rldiena8ud7c1.png?width=778&format=png&auto=webp&s=50f84603681ed38126b9aecdb6c3e24b586c7272\n\n  \nHere is the map they made for a more integrated bus network, one that connected better with the existing bus network DART had at the time. This would definitely be the ideal network compared to the first one we were shown.\n\n  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0x0ti9hfud7c1.png?width=533&format=png&auto=webp&s=190f03a18a95350e5c402b1673712553ef1c0c23\n\n  \nA complete bus network, well integrated into the surrounding transit that already exists, that would serve Mesquite well. This was before GoLink was as big as it is today, so I can imagine DART would have used that a lot more if this were made today, and there would be less fixed routes (but the fixed routes that do exist would be more frequent, run on weekends, etc)  \n\n\nSome of Mesquite's sales tax goes to property tax abatement, and they are considered a \"sales tax rich property tax poor\" city, so that makes it harder for them to join DART. But even with that in mind, its important to remember Mesquite was extremely close to joining DART back in 1983:  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q6fdzic6vd7c1.png?width=986&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5005d72b5f521975b6d34f7ed285002b1711a94\n\n  \nMesquite failed to join DART by just 21 votes in 1983, and since then they have allocated their sales tax to other items. With the sales tax allocated, the barrier to join DART has gotten a lot worse. Now, Mesquite has no transit options other than STAR transit, which isn't good enough.   \nThat doesn't mean we should give up though, if you do live in Mesquite please email your city council and tell them you are interested in DART service. If its important to enough voters then Mesquite will find a way. \n\nA lot of people want DART to expand into Frisco, McKinney, etc. and there is value to getting bus service into those cities, but if you ask me I think there's even more value in serving cities like Mesquite because there is a lot of need there, and Mesquite is adjacent to many transit dependent neighborhoods. Mesquite joining DART would not only serve a lot of people who need transit options they do not currently have, it would also enhance transit for those who live adjacent to Mesquite, and make more commutes possible by transit.   \n\n\nIf you want to see the full presentation I got this information from,  \n\n\nGo here and click Item 7:  \n\n\n[https://dart.new.swagit.com/videos/04102018-904](https://dart.new.swagit.com/videos/04102018-904)  \nitem 7  \\*Briefing on Mesquite Service Plan and Future Service (Patrick J.

SECOND, there is a CCTV display monitor showing what the security cameras are recording. Third, the operators announce the upcoming station arrivals and sometimes throw in a joke here or there, instead of using pre recorded announcements. Finally, most of the trains have already been upgraded to vinyl or plastic seats instead of cloth ones. I have only seen one 1000 series train still with cloth seets.",

It took all day, and we were delayed because the train we were on broke down. Turn out was really strong too \n\nIt was a fun time though, was getting rough near the end but we did it. \n\nMy favorite part of the trip was easily traveling on the south side of the system, on the blue and green lines. I had never been south of MLK station on the green line before, but it's a great ride because you can see some really good nature on your way to Buckner. Blue line as well, as weird as it may sound, UNT Dallas station is basically in a rural area. There are horses right by the station. Probably not the ideal land use for a light rail line, but still not something I usually see as a red line passenger.\n\nI also really wanted to pay attention to safety. Obviously, being in a large group, it always felt super safe. Being in large groups does that. But I can supplement my anecdote here with my experiences as a daily rider too, the train feels a lot safer than it did maybe even a year ago. The sketchiest part was probably just waiting at some of the stations. \n\nIf we have made it to the point where the trains themselves feel safe and the main issue is waiting (not saying we have, my experience is not everyone's) then that's honestly some good progress. We can reduce time spent waiting at stations by increasing frequency. \n\nI had never been to DFW Airport station, I must say it is peak DART station design. The seating was so much better, I wish more stations were like that.\n\nOverall it was a really fun event, and I can now say I have ridden the entire system!",

A lot of people Uber or walk to lower Greenville anyways, it has a good frequent bus route.\n\n8 feels incredibly arbitrary. How did the city come to that conclusion? Do they have some solid math and statistics backing up the fact that this business needs 8 spots specifically if they want to let people eat the cheesecake on-site? What do we need to sacrifice to get those two extra spots built? It's a built out neighborhood already, not really a lot of space. Tear down another business or a home in the name of meeting some arbitrary standard? That seems like a bad idea too.\n\nAnd if this business is short two spots of what the city thinks they need (which could easily be wrong, unless you expect the government to figure out the exact parking needs of every business), why should the city care? I mean, maybe there's a few reasons, but if the business doesn't have enough parking, as a business owner can I not choose to take the L?\n\n\nPeople need to realize cities are different from exurbs on the edge of town. Land is expensive here, parking is NOT easy to provide. It's a huge cost for the business, if I can make my money from transit users/Ubers/pedestrians that can be a huge deal especially in these built out areas where parking can't be added cheaply. \n\n\nAnd even if you think there should be parking minimums, you have to answer this question: how do you accurately determine how much a business needs? Case by case basis? That's really time consuming and presents it's own challenges. Today it's just based on square footage and the type of business it is among other factors. Not a very good metric, and it is arbitrary. If you ever see a business with a giant parking lot that's never full, it's not like the business wanted to build excess parking and waste money on land costs. No, it's because the city requires it. Guess what, that cost of excess parking is past onto the consumer. Parking garages cost a fortune to maintain too, and if there's an unnecessarily large parking garage you will feel it in the prices. It can be hard to compete with these silly requirements forced into you.\n\n\n\nThere's just so many reasons to oppose parking minimums.",

                "body": "Keep in mind that bus routes are often running on different times on weekdays, Saturdays, and Sundays. Not sure is you\u2019re riding on Saturday, but if you are you\u2019ll be dealing with three separate schedules.\n\nA lot of buses will have these little paper brochures for their routes, but not always. Most transfer centers have a rack of them. I\u2019d suggest picking up a #20 brochure and putting it in you bag just in case.\n\nI\u2019d also recommend downloading the GoPass app on your phone. You can get tickets through it, but you can also check bus times, trip plan, etc. They\u2019ve made an effort to improve real time bus tracking so you\u2019ll know when they\u2019re running late. Some of the minor routes are less reliable with tracking, but #20 is a big enough route that it should be reliable.\n\nMy last little tip is to pick up a GoPass Tap Card. You pre-load it, and it will only charge you the minimum. For example, hop on in the morning and it\u2019ll charge you $3 for morning pass, then take it at noon for lunch and it\u2019ll charge you $2 for midday pass. Then take it home in the afternoon it\u2019ll only charge you $1 more for the afternoon pass ($2 for midday + $1 to bring you up to afternoon pass). If you ride enough to get to the month pass total, it won\u2019t charge you at all. In my opinion, it\u2019s the most cost effective for both short term and long term.\n\nIf you have questions hit me up. I\u2019m very familiar with DART and somewhat familiar with the route you\u2019re taking.",

                "body": "Leave early your first time using the bus. Give yourself room for error, while you get an understanding. Your first time riding the bus might go poorly,  but beginners mistakes happen. Make sure you are visible, and show clear intent to board the bus at the stop once the bus arrives. If it's night, I know some people use their phones flashlight to be more visible. Just don't do anything that may make the bus driver think you aren't trying to catch the bus (like walking away from the stop, facing the opposite direction, etc)\n\n\nOnce you're used to the transit commute (which won't take long), you'll get into the habit of riding the bus and probably wont want to drive to work anymore. Just being able to exist and not exert any mental energy into driving after a long day of work is so nice. Being able to read or have that time to yourself becomes something you don't wanna give up. I'm commuting home right now, and I was typing up this response not having to concern myself with the driving.\n\nThat's not to say transit is perfect, it's not, you will run into frustrations. To avoid frustrations or prepare for them better,  download GoPass. Let's you track the bus and delays. If GoPass isn't showing a delay and the bus hasn't arrived yet, don't worry, it's still coming. Sometimes GoPass will take a minute to wake up and realize there's a delay, you did not miss the bus.\n\nAnother tip: make yourself visible at the bus stop. Make yourself look like someone who's trying to catch a bus when the bus is nearby. Don't be walking away. For good measure I wave the bus down but this is not at all required. At night, I use my phone's flashlight just to be safe (especially if there's poor lighting at the stop)\n\nI mainly just recommend trying it out a few times, once you have that familiarity with your bus route that's when you can really learn to relax on the commute. The worst part about riding the bus is catching it because again it could be delayed, stuck at a light, etc. but once you're on it's smooth sailing and you can turn your brain off. Once the habit is built, you won't wanna break it.",

                "body": "That was a good article. Love everything Nadine says. Its cool to see the mayor of Carrolton wanting a solution to the transit funding problem.   \n\n\nI don't really have a strong desire to unify DCTA, Trinity Metro, and DART but I do want DCTA and Trinity Metro to charge a full penny sales tax for their services. And I want The TexRail cities to pay the full sales tax and have feeder bus service to their TexRail stations.  \n\n\nExpansion into new cities is actually a controversial topic on this subreddit. The reason why is because people often conflate member city joining DART with DART having to spread themselves even more thin with new capital costs for rail extensions and new bus services. I think this is a good point, because we could spend hundreds of millions on an LRT extension to a new city, and all that would do is create a a few thousand extra daily riders and shift the commuters who use the end of the line  station further back.  High cost, low return, you spread your riders out over more stations. \n\nI think that more cities do need to join DART though. All the southern Dallas County cities (Cedar Hill, Duncanville, Lancaster,  Grand Prairie, etc) need to be apart of it, Mesquite should be, and more of the Collin County burbs (McKinney, Wylie, Frisco, etc) should all join DART as well. Hell, if Glenn Heights can be a DART city, maybe Corsicana, Waxahachie, Ennis could join too\n\nBut that doesn't mean we need to expand rail to all these places. Its honestly really bad that you can't take a bus from Parker Road to Downtown McKinney, that should be a thing and the fact that its not is just... bad. Whatever sales tax McKinney has to offer, it would be more than enough to fund that kind of service and maybe some feeder routes and GoLink.   \n\n\nSure, expanding the rail may not be the best idea given the financial constraints, but at all of our suburban end of line stations we should have several regional/express buses connecting you all over the place.  There should also be more regional express buses in Downtown Dallas.  The fact that you can't get on a bus in Downtown Dallas to go to UT Arlington is just... really unusual and really bad. Because of these gaps that could be fixed with money that doesn't even need to come from existing DART tax payers, DART is a lot less useful to the residents it serves.   \n\n\nWe could have buses that go everywhere, feeding our network,, and it would be funded by money coming in from new cities who pay nothing to DART today.  Seems like a win-win to me.\n\nYou see those kinds of bus routes in places like Seattle, Toronto, New Jersey. We could really bolster the light rail ridership if we could add new bus services from new member cities joining. In Denver, which has a very flawed rail system, one thing thats cool is every single little town is served by transit. \n\nDART's board is elected proportionally by population, making it very equitable. We are not like other transit agencies (such as SEPTA) where every member jurisdiction gets equal vote regardless of population. Because of this equitable board structure, I think we have little to lose and LOTS to gain by taking in more member cities.",

Because of that, while I'd like to see Cedar Hill, Duncanville and other Dallas county cities join DART, I think Collin County needs its own transit authority (with a full cent), but with a regional transit authority that serves to help integrate mobility region wide. A NTTA (North Texas Transit Authority) could be the one to potentially fund projects like regional rail from McKinney to Fort Worth, or Frisco - Dallas, or to do something really awesome like extend the A-Train all the way to Union Station. And such regional mobility doesn't have to be rail - I think our region would actually be really well served by some form of express bus BRT model. Busses going 60-65mph between stations on dedicated highway lanes a la either the Houston network or the Silver line in Los Angeles would probably be easier to achieve a nice network much faster too, especially if these stations connect to frequent local transit connections \n\nLocal agencies will rarely invest in regional connectivity unless it serves their local users well, but a regional authority with its own dedicated funding could do that much easier. Also, having one entity to represent the region as a whole with entities like TxDOT or the feds would likely be beneficial as well as it gives our public transportation entities a more unified voice",

I'm thinking I took a train to catch Loop 12, but I can't quite remember what I would have taken next. I remember I had a walk quite a ways since the buses didn't go all the way to I-20 back then, and I think I got off at a stop on Wheatland Rd. \n\nWould anyone happen to know what routes I would have taken, or have a map that old?

I'd much rather have a bus on a consistent (though preferably frequent) schedule than have an unreliable ride share service where my wait can be anywhere between 5-50 minutes, and not even know when you request it how much longer the wait truly is since the wait times are always projected more positively in the app than the reality on the ground.\n\n\nAlso a sidenote, I'm incredibly skeptical that an aerial ride share is better environmentally or economically than even traditional cars are since aerial vehicles have to fight gravity in addition to most of the normal forces cars or buses face. Ultimately I won't be surprised to see it turn into an amenity for the wealthy at the expense of the average city, all so the city can pretend to have invested in \"transit.\"",

The last vote was in 2002.\" I'm also all ears if you have suggestions on how to write that line.\n\nP.S.: Arlington can't vote on dedicating sales tax revenue to transit right now.

The city puts 1% into its general fund, .5% to paying off Globe Life Field, .25% to street maintenance and .25% to its economic development corporation.",

I think there's a lot of interest in it, but it would take a huge effort to get the people who want it to the polls. And I'm well aware of the sales tax budget issues, although our mayor and city manager have expressed interest in transitioning the stadium debt sales tax to funding public transit once that's an option. And there are still other mechanisms for funding transit, like tax increment financing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI get that as a reporter, you're covering a lot of different issues about different places and that you just can't get everything right.

People complain of the app crashing constantly, or the app saying 'no rides available' or that your next ride is constantly \"several minutes away\" and other issues that make using the service unreliable, and each individual ride is anywhere from $3.00 to $5.00, which is *very expensive.* On the Apple app store, there's only one 5 star review, and on the Play Store there's only two, and one of those two just says \"I got the app install\".

        "selftext": "This has nothing to do with the changes happening this year, we don't know when this will happen yet. But DART is making some really positive changes to the Route 3 and Route 13.\n\nWith these changes, the route 3 will easily become DART's highest ridership bus route (not counting UTD.... yeah always gotta put that caveat in there)\n\nSo, here is the current configuration of the route 13 and route 3\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e4fuqs125f3c1.png?width=723&format=png&auto=webp&s=31a2ef70e714ef2e2ca2a41333ce436c14b77da7\n\nThis is the route 3, which connects West End to SMU/Mocking bird Via Ross Avenue and Matilda.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ms8llsab5f3c1.png?width=873&format=png&auto=webp&s=042056ee86288ddeac12f6fd352a90165fda6431\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd here is the route 13, which travels up Ervay to reach Downtown Dallas.\n\nI really like what DART is planning with these routes. One day, these routes will become just one route that run through downtown dallas. There will no longer be a route 13, as it has now turned into the extended route 3.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[There probably will be stops further up on Ervay, this is a crude drawing in MS paint from a trip planning tool. ](https://preview.redd.it/k4il9vpp6f3c1.png?width=669&format=png&auto=webp&s=40551a7575073dee56e10c9887b3559e53928e20)\n\nAnd the best part, this route will retain the route 3's 15 minute all day and weekend frequency, meaning that this is a frequency boost for South Dallas residents.\n\nThe only downside is that this doesn't hit the west end transfer center, but you can still transfer on elm, commerce, and the light rail fairly easily. And I think you can still transfer to the route 239 pretty easily since you get close to San Jacinto.\n\nThe source for all this information comes from this document:  [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1siHnQ7Gy6GICjO6a63jzqc1FDM\\_PW\\_aP/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1siHnQ7Gy6GICjO6a63jzqc1FDM_PW_aP/view?usp=sharing)\n\nIt is noted that combining these routes increases the number of locations South Dallas residents can get to without a transfer.\n\nLets get into ridership numbers too, I would grab screenshots but I cant connect to [dart.org](https://dart.org) right now, so take my word for it. In October, the route 13 got 2,400 riders per weekday, and the route 3 got 1,400 riders per weekday. Those are good numbers, especially because these routes aren't the longest.\n\nCombining these routes into one will bring the total to 3,800 riders per weekday, higher than even the route 57\n\nExcept, I expect the gains to be even higher because these changes will provide more frequency for South Dallas portion of this route. So maybe this new route will achieve 4,000 riders per day. That would be great. Granted, most of those 4,000 riders will be the same riders who ride the 13 and 3 today, just counted under the same route.",

My fat tires actually helps give tight squeeze keeping bike in place. Biggest test was when I carried my e-bike on the 239 bus to Addison Circle, which runs highway speeds on DNT; held up just fine! What I've seen first-hand is a bike actually being too light and thin that it bounced out of the holder; if the bus hadn't just stopped, it would've rolled over the bike as you described. After witnessing that, what I'd advise for anyone is have a little bungee cord for quickly fastening your tire to the rack.",

Sometimes I'll see signs that say \"no motorized vehicles beyond this point\" on trails entrance, so far the Internet seems to indicate that includes e-bikes, but it's vague. I mostly find articles saying that here in Texas e-bikes (types 1-3) are not allowed on park trails but doesn't explicitly say trails like Kathy or Santa Fe. It also doesn't explain if turning off the motor or setting pedal assist to zero makes the e-bike into a \"non-motorized\" vehicle.\n\nI know I got a little of topic, where I can ride is a big factor for me before I buy the e-bike.",

Just be courteous around others and you'll be absolutely fine. I'm out on trails and sidewalks every day. There's no enforcement of anything, and you'll quickly learn to do what actually makes sense and is safe, rather than what it may say in some legal document.\n\nI checked and you can legally ride an electric bicycle on sidewalks (except downtown) and trails within the City of Dallas. To explore the regulations a bit...\n\nOn sidewalks: \"it shall not be unlawful to ride a bicycle or an electric bicycle on a public sidewalk anywhere in the city outside of the central business district\" ([Dallas City Code, Volume 1, Chapter 9, Article 1, Section 9-1](https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/dallas/latest/dallas_tx/0-0-0-103253)\\]. The central business district is basically downtown, within the freeway loop. But there's zero enforcement of this. I see the Segway tours, even the Downtown Safety Patrol themselves riding on the sidewalk. Slowly and safely, yes. With a near total lack of bike lanes downtown, that's absolutely the correct decision, City Code be damned.\n\nFor other restrictions within Dallas, including parks and trails, see [Volume 1, Chapter 28, Article 6, Division 1, Section 28-41.1.1](https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/dallas/latest/dallas_tx/0-0-0-112534). Motor assisted scooters are prohibited in parks and on sidewalks, but electric bicycles are allowed. There's some stuff like you have to wear a helmet if you're a child, can't go over the posted speed limit or 20 mph, etc.\n\nElectric bikes are legally *not* motor vehicles (which require registration with Department of Motor Vehicles). I haven't seen a specific legal definition of a \"motorized vehicle\" so I'm not sure what those signs mean, if anything. I'm guessing ATVs, mini motorcycles, stuff like that.\n\nFor state-level regulations, see the Texas Transportation Code [Title 7, Subtitle C, Chapter 551](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/docs/TN/htm/TN.551.htm). And [Section 664.001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/TN/htm/TN.664.htm#664.001) for the legal classification of electric bicycle types.",

The TRE and light rail operate very differently and in very different neighborhoods. \n\nOne other thing to consider is the higher fares. If someone who may have drug issues or mental health issues wants to shelter on the TRE it will cost twice as much. But even then, if you are homeless the TRE is just harder to get to. \n\nBeing easier to get to is not inherently a problem, but DART light rail needs more ridership because when trains are full they are much safer. There's a lot of social pressure when everyone stares at you when you display some weird behavior. Jane Jacobs \"eyes on the street\" principle applies too, less crime happens when there's more potential witnesses. Although that doesn't tell the full story as light rail has much better ridership than the TRE.\n\nI think that the DART system is just m harder to police. It's vast in comparison to the TRE, is serves a different crowd (one more socioeconomically diverse), goes through some high crime neighborhoods, is easier to access (but not high enough ridership to make up for it), and has more stations. More stations per mile even. I also think that going through downtown Dallas works against DART, downtown Fort Worth feels a lot safer and a lot more chill than downtown Dallas. \n\nI think that commuter/regional train systems like the TRE probably always feels safer than local metros or light rail (but that's just a guess)\n\nAs for cleanliness, a lot of the same points apply. Less trains to clean, bigger trains so the mess is more spread out. The crowd that leaves trash behind just doesn't ride the TRE and isn't served by it.\n\nIt can also be argued that DART'S safety problems are more of a reflection of the member cities it serves than anything else. Make the member cities safer, and you'd see DART get safer.",

The DART All Station Tour is something I've been wanting to do for a while now, especially since there are many parts of DART's rail network I still haven't seen. It'll involve visiting every DART station and riding every mile of track over the course of **10 hours**, with a 35 minute lunch break about halfway through. Everyone is invited to join and if you do, you'll receive a neat sticker to commemorate the event!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMore info below:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##What date/time?\n\n**December 2nd (Saturday) from 9:00am to 6:50am**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##Where are we starting and ending?\n\nThe route **starts at Victory Station @ 9:00am** and **ends at Victory station @ 6:50pm**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##How much does it cost?\n\nYou only need to buy the $6 Day Pass for DART. There are no other costs, unless you plan on buying your lunch.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##Do I need to ride the entire route?\n\nNot at all! The schedule is available publicly, so feel free to join in and drop out whenever you want. Everyone who participates will get a sticker regardless of whether you stay (But those who ride the entire route will get something special!)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##What should I bring?\n\nSnacks, water, weather-appropriate clothing (*we'll wait be waiting on platforms*) and a battery bank are recommended.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##When will we eat?\n\nWe will have a **35 minute lunch break at 1:37pm**. This is roughly halfway through the 10 hour day. We will take our break at **SMU/Mockingbird Station**, which has several options for dining including a Jason's Deli. We'll also have several 10-20 minute transfers, where you can eat any food/snacks brought with you.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##What if a train is late or we miss a connection?\n\nDue to the way the trains are scheduled, we can take a later train and still have subsequent connections line up. So missing a train shouldn't be a big deal, but we will try to stay on schedule.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##Are there restrooms/other services available during the trip?\n\nYes. We will be waiting at several stations for over 10 minutes, and many of these have restrooms and other services either inside the station or close by. [You can view a list along with other info by clicking this link.](https://arlingtonpublictransit.com/darttour2023)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt's my goal to make this a safe and fun experience so if you have any questions I didn't cover, feel free to ask. I hope to see you there!",

Four of the six cars are cab cars. This is a waste because cab cars are more expensive than passenger cars. And they can purchase a small number of shorter trains for weekend, night operation, which can also be reconnected together as they are now. I like the 5-car train on the bottom. But I\u2019m not sure whether Citylink can reach 65 mph without redesign.

Ideally they find a way to keep the SLRVs going, but idk if that's possible.\n\nIdr if they officially said anything, but I think Stadler CityLink is the best bet. Its the only light rail vehicle I know of that can hit comparable speeds to the SLRV and can serve the transit mall. I think Dart really shouldn't go with a custom solution again, elsewise the lifespan will be shorter than it should be since we don't have the scale to justify just making our own parts.",

It's insane to me to even entertain the idea of keeping those cars one day longer than they absolutely have to. We'll get new LRVs that look a little less unique, but which have parts ready to go off the shelf from the manufacturer, which minimizes downtime after a failure. Between that and the fact that we could get parts which have already been tried and tested, brand new cars are the absolute best thing that could happen to DART.",

I'm not normally a fan of more government regulation, but I see no better solution than for the city to require public restrooms in more places.",

        "selftext": "Elizabeth Reich went to UTD to speak with Comets for Better Transit (CFBT), a student organization based in Richardson/UTD, they probably do more DART and transit advocacy than anyone else which is great to see.\n\nElizabeth is AWESOME. We are lucky to have her as CFO. She is the exact type of leadership you would want for DART. She is still new to the transit agency but I look forward to seeing what she can accomplish over the years. \n\nI took way too long to get my notes out, this happened weeks ago, and of all the meetings I have taken notes on this is the best. \n\nHere are my notes from the meeting:  \n\n\n* The CEO has been building an executive team since she joined, and the team she has built has a sense of urgency for improving DART, and are deeply committed to improving the service\n   * It was this passion from the executive team that made Elizabeth chose to work at DART\n* Staff comes up with plans, it is Elizabeth's job to make those plans happen\n   * ex: if Rob Smith wants a new bus route, she has to find the resources to fund it and sustain the funding\n* She noted that there is a shift in the agency and what they are trying to do. DART has been focused on big capital projects to build out the light rail system\n   * as a result, DART operated very conservatively, and was very tight with money to preserve capital, pay the bills\n* So, lots of DART staff has been focused on saving money, trying to spend as little as possible.\n* Elizabeth brings a new perspective to the table. \n   * \"We are not serving the public if we do not spend the money that comes in through taxes\" \n   * \"As a public servant, I'm not trying to leave money on the table\"\n   * \"If we have money, we ought to be doing more for the people who are paying taxes that we (DART) are using\"\n* As CFO, her goal is to invest in service improvements \n   * This means more buses, more golink, better frequencies (tier1 and tier 2)\n* The perspective she speaks about here is new to DART\n   * But she assures us that she isn't a bureaucrat who wants to spend money willy-nilly \n* She hopes to make a difference at DART with their financial management\n* I asked about a tier 2 timeline, she was not able to give specifics\n   * In the immediate term, the money is not there\n      * but as you know, sales tax revenue grows\n   * Its really hard to predict when DART will have the money for tier 2\n   * It depends on inflation, the sales tax growth, fare revenues, and the economy\n   * Every year, they revise the financial plan and will be looking at how they can increase capacity\n* \"I will do my best to put in as much money as possible into making tier one/tier two a reality as soon as possible\"\n* We will get to tier 2, its just gonna take time. The question is, how much time will it take?\n* DART is actually leveraging transit oriented development to make money. They are leasing their excess land at mockingbird station to developers, so they can make money off of the development the light rail attracts (and TOD also adds tax base, fare revenue for DART)\n   * they can do this to other stations as well\n      * Addison, Downtown Carrolton, Richardson, several in Dallas\n* Irving and their community loves and needs transit (Cool!)\n* GoLink expenses are increasing a lot\n   * GoLink contract funding increased by $2.5 million, and the uber contract budget increased by $5 million\n* GoLink has an expensive cost per passenger fixed route buses just don't have\n   * BUT providing fixed route buses in those areas would be far higher than the cost of GoLink\n   * So, when do you decide you have enough riders in an area to justify fixed route service?\n* They are going to fund modernization projects to speed up trains through downtown dallas\n* Someone asks if DART is being proactive in trying to get more member cities to join\n   * Elizabeth didn't know of anything in the works.\n   * If cities wanted to dedicate 1% sales tax to DART, DART would work with them\n   * Elizabeth doesn't think there is any hope that McKinney, Frisco, Arlington would give up their sales tax to transit\n      * they would rather give it away to businesses\n   * Plano is frustrated about this, because they want to spend their sales tax on economic development\n      * (I'd argue this would be a waste of Plano's money, as they managed to achieve near full build out without it)\n* Elizabeth theorizes that, Collin County folks and Dallas county folks could get on the same page and go to the state legislature to create a new transit tax\n   * Dallas County cities want economic development, but currently spend sales tax on DART\n   * maybe some Collin county cities, or other cities outside the DART service area, want DART but they spend sales tax on DART\n   * Perhaps, they could join forces and go to the state legislature and ask for a new way to further increase sales tax, so economic development cities can get transit and transit cities can get economic development corporations\n* DART staff is talking with city staff from every city to figure out what each city is planning. The goal is to figure out the cities future development plans and figuring out how DART can assist with transportation needs.\n   * These are called area plans, and they are in progress. We'll find out more in 2024\n   * DART should also have a \"strategic plan\"\n   * and hopefully, the CFO can finance these things for 2025 budget\n* DART will not add new cities for anything less than a full penny\n   * if they did, the other member cities would be very angry\n   * if they, for example, let Arlington join for half a penny, the other member cities would get angry  because they don't have half a penny to spend on sports stadiums or whatever like Arlington does\n   * And the member cities would want to decrease their contributions to DART if they let other cities in for less money\n* She brings up that collin county wants to be a low tax city\n   * They have boxed themselves in with toll roads, yet they claim to be low tax\n      * but you have to pay the forced car ownership tax and the tollroad tax to live there\n   * They don't have a public hospital, they send everyone to Parkland on DART\n      * My perspective (NOT HERS) is that collin county cities would rather leech off of other cities making good investments so they can keep their status as \"low tax\"\n      * They wont invest in DART, or a public hospital, and they are reliant on tolls. Its evil (again my words, not hers), but it is what it is\n* When Elizabeth was CFO of Dallas, she wondered why Dallas was paying for the oak cliff streetcar and not DART\n   * Then, when she joined DART, she learned Dallas owns that streetcar line and pays DART to operate it. DART did not build it, so it makes since for Dallas to fund it\n   * and Dallas agreed to pay the operations and maintenance when they built the streetcar\n* Richardson Rocks!\n   * she mentioned that Richardson has been a great partner to DART, they have good plans with transit oriented development, Gary Slagel has been a fantastic representative for Richardson who has done a good job advocating for Richardson\n   * Gary Slagel is a true believer in DART, he is very committed to DART. He is a transit guy\n* Her first DART bus ride was to UTD for this meeting!\n   * she rides the trains, but has not had an opportunity to ride a DART bus until this meeting\n   * we rode the bus back to cityline with her, on the route 232\n* Conversation between the president of Comet's for better transit and Elizabeth happened\n   * Seems like they think 883 ridership is/was undercounted\n   * they rely on manual counts in the charter buses used to run the 883 east route\n      * but now, the 883 east has some DART buses, so for the first time there is some automatic passenger counting on the DART bus\n      * which means we have a closer to reality count on the 883 ridership\n* For this years budget, frequency increase on the buses and light rail\n   * They had the money to increase frequency even more\n   * but they didn't think they could hire and train enough employees. That was the main limiting factor\n   * The limiting factor was hiring 40 people\n* Talking about tier 1 and tier 2 with the board and keeping them engaged with the discussion is important\n   * get them used to it, keep talking about it, and encourage them to engage\n   * Board members typically don't vote for something the first time they hear it\n* The board seems to be reluctant to increase service\n   * Though there is disagreement on fixed route vs golink\n   * Plano LOVES golink for example, so they might want to prioritize golink service\n* Weatherization is coming (against both heat and ice) and money is being committed for it\n   * and even right now, they are working on it. Painting the tracks white lowered the temperature by 10 degrees\n   * installing cameras on catenary lines to identify problems quicker\n* They are going to spend $100 million on protecting against sever weather\n* Nadine Lee's Mantra is 10 by 10\n   * 10 minute frequent transit within 10 minute walk within everywhere in the service area\n   * that is what she has asked Elizabeth to fund\n   * Elizabeth in response said \"I am not going to get to 10 by 10 anytime soon, that is super ambitious\"\n   * But the CEO is pushing staff for better service as much as possible\n* \"One of the things I have been asked to take a look at is providing real time location data to Google\"\n   * Elizabeth noted that, newer riders are going to use google maps or apple maps long before they find out about gopass\n   * The room clapped\n* Dallas is investing some of their public transportation improvement funds (provided by DART) on signal prioritization\n   * In other words: bus priority \n* After the silver line, there won't be a lot of rail happening\n* I asked \"What did removing D2 from the financial plan enable you to do?\"\n   * $300 million went to train replacement project \n      * Trains went up in cost\n   * $700 million on modernized signal \n      * this should, among a LOT of other things, speed up trains through downtown and allow for improving light rail frequency\n   * $300 million miscellaneous important items\n      * Its in the budget if you wanna dig it up\n   * If this was not done, then there's no way DART would have the money to do service improvements like tier1/tier2\n* Elizabeth thinks that if/when D2 is looked at again, they should look at routing that goes further south into downtown\n* New Convention Center might lead to a new convention center station\n   * current convention center station is weirder, dark, uninviting\n   * issues with loiterers hanging out. Gets scary under there\n   * with the convention center redo, they need to do something better ",

Somehow this ended up being a rant against colin in the second to last bullet\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I love her take on d2. Its necessary, but the current routing makes little sense, and not *as* urgent as bus improvements. Anyone I've seen mad about d2 being canceled only seemed to care about how it meant dart was incompetent or america will never build good transit again. (Not that there aren't legitimate criticisms about d2's cancellation, but most of the rhetoric I've seen didn't even seem to care about where d2 even was, just that it was an expensive subway project cancelled bc of budget.\n* There's a lot of things that just seem cool. They seem to be getting to all the boring stuff that the previous admin snuffed in favor of building the nation's largest LRT network\n* Love to see the emphasis on tod's. I wonder how much can be done in places that aren't currently tod but really should be. (looking at half the stations on dart.)\n* Legacy always seemed like a killer place for transit being as dense as it is. I wonder if Legacy mainly being served by golink is due to the surrounding land use being just that bad or Plano being really insistent that the area needs golink no matter what.\n* The collin thing is even worse than you say because... its not even low tax(despite leeching of DART cities.) The property tax rates are actually *higher* in Frisco/Mckinney than in Plano. In Frisco's case the EDC is mainly attracting stadiums (I'm including PGA stuff here even if not a stadium) or VC grifts. Non-highway things our transportation money has gone to: Uber Elevate, Smart signals (for new Audis, not busses), multiple different small delivery robots (though these trials were short lived.) All our new development is either on DNT or Preston (and custer in McKinney's case.) If you live where most people live in east frisco, it is easier and cheaper to drive to plano than it is to drive to all the stuff in Frisco bc of the tolls. I don't even want Frisco to join Dart tbh. They're on the DCTA board (in a non voting capacity) and they consistently lobby for busses to be replaced by on demand service and reduced rail service. Lobbying from non voting cities is a big part of why DCTA busses have had such a big cut in favor of gozone.  I don't know why since it doesn't even affect Frisco. If they had any actual voting capacity in DCTA or DART, it'd be disastrous. As sad as it makes me not to get a train, *you should not want us.* At least Plano wants some transit, even if they like golink more than they should. Frisco is x10 worse\n* Glad to see Irving is not that, I found that surprising. (Though perhaps I shouldn't have, in hindsight, seems like they've done a good job of lobbying for new rail projects to through them.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd edit: thx for compiling these notes. It helps with knowing what's actually going on",

Would definitely appreciate more info on what you know regarding Frisco's involvement in DCTA. Thank you so much for the info, and excellent thoughts overall! Here's hoping we can get Frisco to actually be interested in (and responsible with) transit!",

Some were open to the idea (though not necessarily a supporter) and others were entirely focused on vehicle throughput.\n\nRereading what I said, I think my tone was a *little* too harsh on Frisco. They were supporting gozone, but I don't think it was some scheme to destroy bus service. Looking at old board meetings, I just thought they were vastly oversold on what microtransit was capable of. The rest of DCTA was clearly also convinced sooner or later, and while Frisco lobbied for it, they were hardly the reason for it. \n\nThe reason I worry about Frisco joining Dart is because they're going to be asking for very expensive golink, and generally be hostile to bus and rail expansions, and some of that will bleed over (especially to cities like Plano which already like golink a bit too much.) And frankly a lot of the transit best suited for Frisco doesn't fit with Dart's current goals. Properly joining DCTA (by which I mean paying in the half cent tax or some alt source of funding) might be a better fit in that regard. Sending A-Train to Frisco, and adding gozone might be the move",

It's true that Frisco has been a little too micro-transit focused (though speaking with some council members, they've finally snapped out of it with the apparent failures of self-driving test runs and the like) so a DART join now could do more harm than good.\n\nIt just sucks because Frisco has this absolutely PERFECT right of way running right through it, but it's positioned in such a way that it should be a DART service (beginning in Carrollton, terminating as far north as they're willing to let it) rather than a DCTA service. I hope Frisco realizes that stuff like Go-link is such a band-aid solution, like Arlington is RIGHT THERE as proof this concept really doesn't work when compared to more traditional transit methods! But what can I expect from a city so obsessed with its Teslas, Mazarattis, Audis, and BMWs? Hopefully we can get some positive change (I will say, the plans for the Rail District look like a real step up for walkable design) but we'll probably have to fight for it.\n\nThank you for expanding on what you meant, and I wish you luck in getting that intersection fixed!",

        "selftext": "This meeting is old, I happened upon it recently. The [meeting is from July 10th](https://garlandtx.new.swagit.com/videos/264102?ts=242)\n\nSome of it is information we already know, and there will be overlap with other meeting notes I have given from other events.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI should also note, this was just before security improved a lot on DART\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere are my notes:  \n\n\n* Lake Ray Hubbard Transit Center Transit oriented development coming soon\n* Nearly 20% of DART bus routes serve Garland \n* Garland's city manager is very supportive of DART and is working with them to improve bus service for Garland\n* Downtown Garland Stations is getting a maintenance facelift \n   * Transit center rehab\n   * replacing/repairing seating, canopies, etc.\n* More bus shelters coming\n* More security still coming. Police have been slow to hire, but they are filling those vacancies\n* DART police are only allowed to police DART property, so DART wants to partner with city police to better patrol stations\n* No current plans for expanding GoLink service within Garland\n   * There are plans to try zone to zone service in Garland\n   * This makes since, because Garland is heavily served by bus, making GoLink redundant and potentially expensive to run (GoLink works best in areas of low transit demand)\n* Nadine noted that bus ridership is recovering more than rail\n   * although, I think this is no longer true, I believe rail has recovered more now (but I could be wrong)\n* Lake Ray Hubbard Transit center will be re-opened in 2024.\n* Comprehensive fare study looking at student discount (or hopefully free fares for students)\n* Improvements being made to CCTV systems to improve security on buses, trains, and stations\n* Nadine Lee is working on a new security strategy, to determine how DART can better use existing security to create a better sense of security.\n   * this makes sense, because hiring police takes so long\n\n&#x200B;\n\nImpressions on council:  \n\n\n(I am not a Garland resident, nor do I follow their news as much as I follow Dallas and Richardson. My impressions on council are limited, as I've only seen this meeting)  \n\n\nDebora Morris was supportive of DART, wants to see the service improve. Wanted to see security improved, and wants to see more GoLink  \n\n\nDylan Hedrick was curious about how ridership recovery was going in Garland, and wanted to know how the new bus network was performing. He seemed like a supporter from what little I heard from him.  \n\n\nB.J. Williams wants to see the Lake Ray Hubbard Transit oriented development happen. He wanted to know why Lake Ray Hubbard transit center shutdown (it was due to pandemic). He wanted to see DART reopen the facility because it would help his community. He is a self proclaimed huge fan and supportive of DART. He wants to see bus shelters city wide (though acknowledged its not realistic). Wants a student pass program. Thumbs up from me.   \n\n\nMargaret Lucht asked about the ridership in Garland (the boardings on the buses/trains), asking how they are preventing fare evasion. Not enough for me to gauge how much of transit supporter she is, but maybe someone who has more Garland knowledge can help me out here.  \n\n\nEd Moore liked the presentation. He talked about the need for more safety and security. He seemed very supportive of transit but he only asked about safety so its hard to know for sure off of this meeting alone.  \n\n\nCarissa Dutton asked bout improving safety on rail crossings, to ensure people aren't hit by the trains. Again, can't parse out if she is a transit supporter off that one question alone. \n\n  \nScott LeMay (mayor) seemed interested, but he didn't ask any questions.\n\n  \nI can only determine so much from this meeting. Would appreciate anymore insight on council members and their stance on transit. \n\nB.J. Williams was awesome though.",

DART is not considering anything like that. I watch every board meeting, engage with them everytime they talk to the public.

Can't give you a timeline though, maybe within 5 or 6 years? DART is looking to speed up trains in downtown and make that portion more reliable and on time. They have the money for it, everything is in the planning phase right now. Signal upgrades will make it possible. But doesn't help your current situation much unfortunately.",

Maximizing our current infrastructure also seems like an easier political fight, and would benefit existing and upcoming TODs around already functioning stations and connections to the trail system. \n\nI do still think a Central Link streetcar is a good idea as part of a network also including an M-Line extension to Knox St, but those seem like better ideas once the DART rail stations along their routes are running at capacities sufficient to provide steady ridership demand.",

A plan is afoot at City Hall to connect two existing streetcar systems \u2014 the 2.45-mile Bishop Arts route that ends at EBJ/Union station downtown and the M-Line Trolley, the 4.6-mile route that runs from the Dallas Arts District at the other edge of downtown to West Village in Uptown. The plan, known as the Central Link, has been on the drawing board since 2005 and will join the two lines by creating streetcar infrastructure through downtown.\n\nThe limited route of the Bishop Arts streetcar means that its ridership is low. The M-Line Trolley and the Bishop Arts streetcar collectively had a ridership of around 144,900 during April, May and June of this year. The Central Link expansion is important to help realize the full potential a streetcar system can have in terms of economic development and ridership. It will also be vital to help create other extensions into West Dallas and further South in Oak Cliff.\n\nAs our region grows, we\u2019re going to need transportation options other than single-occupant vehicles. The Central Link project may be the key to building a robust streetcar system that can serve new areas and transportation needs that buses and light rail can\u2019t.",

I've also been making maps of the existing system because we need more useful transit maps; different maps for different purposes.\n\nA complete system map is something I've wanted to see for a while, but at scale it's way too daunting for me to attempt. So major kudos to you for going for it! And doing pretty well thus far! Sometimes when I see someone else's map, I want just to make my own version because there's a lot I would do differently. But your map is so good I'd much rather sit back and see you improve it further.\n\nSome thoughts & ideas:\n\n* I love that you included lakes, rivers, and greenways. They provide a sense of scale and location that is typically served by the highway network (which I'm also happy you omitted). Greenways also hint at existing, planned, or potential bicycle networks, so they also serve as indications of transportation options.\n* Consider cropping the map to the farthest edge of the service area. Kinda hard to explain verbally, I'll edit to add a quick & dirty attempt at what I mean.\n* Publish a version without legend and label. In other words, publish the map and legend as separate assets. That way, remixers can embed the map in various dimensions and mediums (poster, letter, flyer, web page, etc). \n* In the legend, use a b&w or greyscale circle to represent junctions. I see you opted to show multiple colored circles at junctions; I suggest using the greyscale circle by default and reserving multi-color circles to represent stations that are in close proximity but not shared (for example, TRE Medical/Market Center Station is very close to Market Center Station, but they're separate). The same goes for DFW Airport Terminal A Station and Terminal B Station).",

This is good bc there aren't many people taking the train in between legacy and the silverline, and there's a lot of places on dnt that needs transit access. Downside is building here is harder than existing row, and building new tod is next to impossible. \n\nThere are actual studies that include legacy to dt Carrollton. Sometimes it interlines with other lines (silverline westbound or green line southbound.) One interesting idea I've seen is if frisco ever wants rail, they could join dcta and you'd have the a train go down to do Carrollton and that back up to legacy and then to downtown frisco. Another js a line to Irving on the same rail row, though imo this is the worst option. \n\nUltimately there's the issue of politics. Plano doesn't like it when frisco, allen, and mckinney park and ride in plano. They've complained a lot. They also seem to... not like transit very much. Instead of lobbying for busses and trains, they want more golink. I might be misremembering bc I heard this a while ago, but they asked for more golink and less busses in legacy.

I came to DFW from NYC and was happy to see that we have a public train. That being said, the socio economic diversity of the trains in NYC were greater than in Dallas. When I ride the train here, I was finding myself as the only one in professional dress (suit and tie for work). I felt this made me a target for solicitations, which I didn't enjoy. I don't carry cash and dislike telling people no. I decided to not ride the train any longer when I witnessed shouting matches and a near stabbing two days in a row. With two kids at home, I have a lot to lose and didn't feel safe. Am I alone in this thinking? I don't like driving to work, but I am hesitant to take the trains again.

                "body": "The most unsafe I feel in DART is definitely when altercations between others happen. Typically, I move to a different part of the train.\n\nI was getting asked for money when I was a newer rider. But that stopped happening after a while, I'm not sure if something with my body language changes as I got more comfortable.\n\nThat being said, I'm surprised that you don't see more diversity in socio economic status. Sounds like you are a rush hour rider, I typically see lots of business commuters heading to downtown Dallas on weekdays.\n\nTimes light right now, during the state fair, you see more families riding.\n\nOff peak times or weekends, you definitely do see a lower income crowd.\n\n\nWith all that being said, DART can feel unsafe, but if you substitute a DART commute for driving for safety reasons, you end up not doing yourself any favors.\n\nThe statistical reality is that DART is far safer than driving. \n\n\nHere's the thing, I think when we drive we may not be as aware of the danger, so it feels safer but that's actually a problem. For example, two people on public transit get into a yelling match. This is scary, you see the danger first hand. However, maybe there's a driver on the highway also getting into a fight with their passenger. They could be yelling and screaming at each other, while the driver operates a 2 ton vehicle. This is arguably worse than two people getting in an argument on public transit, but you, the other drivers on the road, are left completely unaware this is happening. At this point, attention is not on the road and a major accident could easily happen, leading to injury or death.\n\n\nWe often see drivers who run red lights, or aren't paying attention, swerve across multiple lanes of traffic to not kiss their exit. We see these scenarios, and think \"on what an asshole\", and move on with our lives. But it's ways to forget just how close to death you may have been in that circumstance, because driving is so normalized.\n\nDART is hiring more police and security, and will eventually (if hiring goes well, which it is so far) have a cop on every train. Crime is also declining on DART, which is really impressive because ridership is also increasing. I made a post about the latest police update here: https://www.reddit.com/r/dart/comments/179qhig/crime_declining_on_dart_police_vacancies_getting/\n\nThat post goes into more detail.\n\n\nBut I think the bottom line, statistically speaking DART is safer than driving. There's a reason why it's so rare you hear about death or injury on DART. With driving, you have no idea who around you is distracted, sleepy, on drugs, etc. So a lot of the danger is hidden. DART is getting safer, and security is increasing.\n\n\nThat's my take on the matter. I hope it helps",

That being said, as people return to in person work, as ridership recovers, as schools go back to in person, you do see more of that socio economic diversity you were talking about.\n\nAnd ridership recovery has been really strong lately. If it has been a while since you've ridden, you will see that the trains are more crowded now and have more middle class or upper middle class riders. And more police as well.\n\nIn July, they started adding a TOON if security, and we started really seeing the impact of that recently. Cops are slow to hire, but recently DART started hiring security guards to fill the gaps, because they can be hired much more quickly than cops (who are in short supply and require extensive background checks)\n\nBut, even though they have added 97 security gaurds over the past few months, they are still hiring police",

                "body": "I can definitely understand your concerns about safety, but it's important to remember Dallas drivers are absolutely crazy (and also as others have said, DART is just simply safer, even with some of the rambunctiousness on the trains). \n\n[City of Dallas has a Vision Zero Dashboard](https://dallascitydata.dallascityhall.com/views/VisionZeroDashboard/VisionZero?%3Aembed=y&%3AisGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y) where you can see the stats for traffic safety. In 2023, in City of Dallas *only*, there have been 26,716 recorded crashes (absolutely an underestimate), 770 severe injury crashes, and 139 fatal crashes. This doesn't include anything happening in other cities such as Richardson, Plano, Garland, etc. \n\nThat said, I also understand where you're coming from. I recently moved downtown, and when I did, my mom and sister, of their own free will, took the train to come see me from Cityplace/Uptown, only a short trip for a couple of stops. The way down was perfectly fine. But on the way back, they missed their stop at Cityplace, and saw a guy doing drugs. When the train got to Mockingbird, some officers got on board and booted that guy off and out of the station. That didn't stop them from feeling uneasy, but the fact that officers responded so quickly is pretty awesome (they were likely alerted before the train went in the tunnel)\n\nI think the biggest things you can do is always board the train right behind the operator. That is almost always the safest area. The trains always stop in the same spots marked by white poles at the stations, so it should normally be clear where to wait, plus those parts of stations tend to have the highest concentration of people specifically not looking for trouble - so usually a great place to wait. \n\n[Another thing is download and have quick access to the DART See Something Say Something app.](https://www.dart.org/guide/safety-and-security/safety-and-security/dart-say-something-app) In my experience, DART responds very quickly to reports from the app. You can even take photos and choose to remain anonymous as well. It's the best thing for when you see something that breaks DART rules, but especially for truly disruptive or dangerous behavior.\n\nRegarding solicitation, the best 3 things to do are have headphones in (but not necessarily playing music, headphones with passthrough audio are fantastic), act like you are comfortable and familiar with where you are and what you're doing, and if someone does ask, just tell them you don't carry cash. You might get the odd person who says they have cash app or something, but if that happens let them know you don't have those apps or that you aren't comfortable sending money that way. Wish them a good day and don't pay any more attention to them (but still stay alert, obviously).",

As someone else pointed out in this thread, board meetings let you talk directly to the higher ups, the CEO, and the board responsible for making decisions.\n\nI have had talks with staff though, and there's a lot of issues DART has. Part of it is existing in a state that doesn't provide as much funding for public services.\n\n\n\nThe TLDR; I'm about to give is that public transportation in Texas, is dealt a shitty hand\n\nSaw in another comment that you were from Chicago. Texas, in their state constitution, prohibits their department of transportation from funding public transit. This is a huge handicap, as other transit agencies can get funding from local, state, and federal governments. DART cannot receive money from the state, it's prohibited by law and enshrined in the Texas constitution.\n\nWe also have, decades of planning decisions made that change land use to be auto oriented and less pedestrian friendly. This means, when DART operates a service, there's less people it can reach. \n\nDART ends up with a very difficult problem of having to do a LOT with very little. But, if you wanna turn back the clock, it gets worse. The way DART formed, the way it convinced member cities to join (13 cities are a part of DART) is by promising rail to the suburban cities.\n\nNow, politics get involved, because there was a sense of unfairness when say, Plano, got their rail extension while Carrolton didn't have any.\n\nSo, these municipalities, not valuing transit as much as they maybe should, have in the past tried to leave  DART. So to keep everyone happy, DART took on a lot of debt to build the light rail as quickly as possible.\n\n\nAnd in doing so, one could argue they overextended their already limited resources. This was all done with old leadership who are no longer in charge. New leadership has been taking a lot of steps in the right direction. They don't want to build more rail and starve operation budgets paying down capital costs. Silver line is the last major project they are doing for a long time. \n\n\nThere have been a lot of other challenges too, like the pandemic, which just exacerbated so many problems.\n\nFor all the complaints and difficulties we have with DART, their staff is (from what I can tell) doing the best they can. They are motivated, they do care. The higher ups (from my limited conversation with them) are passionate about transit and really do believe in it.\n\n\nThere's more issues I didn't even get into, like the fact that it's now basically impossible for transit to expand into new municipalities (this was not the case when DART formed), some more bad decisions grandfathered in, or issues inflicted by member cities themselves that DART can't really control.",

The update comes from DART chief of police Charles Cato.\n\n* DART police budget is about $56 million per year\n* DART police is accredited by the Texas Police Chiefs Association\n* They  investigate every complaint citizens make against  their employees\n   * if there's an issue, please report it so they know its happening and can fix it\n   * DART police have body cameras\n* They have 97 out of the 100 Transit Security officers they wanted to hire\n   * Contracted security officers, they are armed but are not cops. Can't make arrests but can get people off DART property\n* DART runs 46 trains in the Daytime, 46 in the afternoon, and 16 trains overnight\n* The goal is to have a Police Officer, Fare enforcement officer, or security officer on every train\n   * They do not yet have enough staff to achieve this\n* This would NOT put security on every car. Many trains are run in 2 car sets. In that scenario, you have security in one car but not the other.\n   * The way this will work is they are going to have the officer/security switch between the trains at the station\n* DART has plainclothes police officers riding the trains\n* On October 31st, the board is expected to approve a new program that it will put a team consisting of  mental health clinicians and cops on the trains\n   * Many of these shelter seeking homeless riders have medical issues. This team will triage them, get them onto an ambulance if needed\n   * Help connect them to resources for the homeless and other shelters so they won't use DART as one\n* DART hired 21 police officers this year\n   * but lost 12. Still a net gain. Plus they have those 97 extra contract security officers. Overall, security presence has improve a good amount\n   * Only 6 of those people left. Two were fired, the rest retired.\n* DART isn't losing officers anymore because of a massive pay raise they gave the police\n   * Pay is now very competitive\n   * For 8 weeks, DART paid their police more than anyone else in North Texas\n      * Other police departments based their raises and budgets on how much money DART was paying\n* They have 38 police vacancies\n* 40 fare enforcement vacancies (70 out of 110)\n* Crime did increase after the pandemic\n   * this is because during the pandemic the trains were empty and pandemic related issues\n* However, as of right now crime is declining on DART\n   * Compared to this point in time last year, there is less crime\n   * Even though there are more people riding now than last year\n   * and more police, which should increase the number of reported crime\n   * This is good news for DART safety\n   * But we'll have to see if this trend holds.\n* Chief Cato notes that cooperation with member cities is crucial, as DART does run through some high crime areas.\n* DART has two apps, GoPass and See Something/Say Something\n   * technically, See Something/Say Something is faster. GoPass reports go to customer service first then get routed to police. GoPass still seems to be plenty fast though.\n\nHaving declining crime while also having ridership gains is pretty good. Also, having added 97 security officers and net gaining police is very good. Feeling very optimistic about all this news.\n\nNow, looking at the 40 fare enforcement vacancies,  and 38 police vacancies. With a system that has 65 stations and 48 trains running, if they could fill those vacancies I can see how that would be enough to make the presence even stronger, and strong enough to have a cop on every train.\n\nI also think there may be more than 48 trains during rush hour, but really not sure... Either way, this gives me enough to justify my optimism.\n\nThank you to my friend Hexel for getting this information to me, check out his blog here: [thisdallaslife.com](https://thisdallaslife.com)\n\nHe talks about transit, urbanism, and housing topics.",

Yes, there may be some slight crossover (desperate people can do desperate things) but there's still a huge difference between the homeless and those people who consciously choose the train as a place to commit crimes. And while security and police presence will go a long way towards reducing *crime*, it's nice to see that other approaches are being explored to deal with these wider issues. DART can't solve a problem that's systemic to the city itself, but I think compassion and care can go a long way towards improving the transit experience for everyone. If they just need a warm or dry place to exist, kicking someone off the train does nothing, since they can always just get back on. We need more (safe) places for these people to go as well as resources and information that they can easily access.",

It helps with the problem but doesn't solve it. I do want to point out (not necessarily to you, you may already know this, but to anyone reading) DART doesn't and can't kick people off for being homeless. If you are homeless and follow the rules, you can ride DART just like everyone else.\n\n\nHowever, the reason homeless people get kicked off is because they do cause a lot of problems. I don't wanna group all of them together and say all homeless on DART are bad, they aren't. But a very significant amount are getting on DART and doing drugs, or even if they aren't doing drugs while on the system they definitely do them before getting on. \n\nA lot of them display erratic behavior, making them unpredictable and unsafe to be around. Obviously, they need help. But they should not be near a transit system when they are in this state. \n\nThat is to say, I hope that the homeless who don't cause any problems benefit from this new program. I also hope some of the more erratic or unpredictable homeless also benefit from these services and get redirected off DART until their condition is better.",

        "selftext": "In March 2023, DART presented us with the tier 1 and tier 2 bus plans, and one of the most critical parts of these plans was the promotion of routes to higher frequencies. However, a lot has changed since then, and many routes that aren't getting frequency promotions are starting to perform as well as routes that are getting frequency promotions.\n\nI made this table to demonstrate is that a lot of routes that aren't receiving frequency promotions are starting to do almost as well, or even better, than routes that are getting those 15 minute headways in tier 2.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Bus Route|Areas served|Receiving 15 minute frequency boost?|Average Weekday riders\\*|Riders per revenue hour \\*\\*|Passenger miles per revenue Mile \\*\\*\\*|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Route 241|Coit, West Plano, Forest Ln|No|1598|15.69|6.01|\n|Route 237|Addison, Downtown, Via Preston|No|1023|12.06|6.00|\n|Route 227|Irving, Farmer's Branch, Addison, Brook Haven|No|1310|11.16|4.78|\n|Route 231|Irving, South Belt line, North Lake College|No|905|16.94|5.39|\n|Route 220|Pleasant grove,  Scyene road|No|551|17.52|3.80|\n|Route 232|Frankford, Richardson, North Dallas, Carrolton|No|1186|14.70|5.00|\n|Route 218|Military Parkway, Pleasant Grove|Yes|1000|14.17|4.71|\n|Route 224|I-30, Braodway through Garland, Downtown Dallas|No|901|10.75|4.81|\n|Route 200|Spring Valley, Walnut road, Garland,Dallas,Richardson|Yes|1,150|13.99|4.74|\n|Route 101|Oak Cliff, Medical District, Hampton|Yes|1830|13.60|4.59|\n|Route 104|South Dallas, Oak Cliff, Illinois rd|Yes|1656|16.00|4.45|\n|Route 108|South Oak Cliff, Camp Wisdom, Westmoreland Station|Yes|1369|13.01|4.54|\n|Route 239|Northwest Plano, Addison, DNT, Downtown, Uptown|Yes|1195|11.07|7.51|\n|Route 229|Irving/Carrolton/Addison Via MacArthur and Beltline|Yes|1628|14.74|5.86|\n|Route 230|DFW remote south parking, Downtown Dallas.

This would be a good stretch goal for tier 2\n\n  \n\n\nDefinitions, if you care (skip otherwise):  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\\* Average weekday riders- this tells you how many people use a route, but its not good for evaluating performance. Its not an efficiency metric, the other two are.\n\n\\*\\*Riders per hour - For one hour of labor, how many riders do you get on that route? That is essentially what this measures. A transit agencies biggest cost is labor, so this is a pretty good efficiency metric.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Passenger miles per revenue mile - this measures how many passenger miles a bus carries for every mile it drives in service. This is a good way to measure capacity utilization. How \"full\" a route is\n\n(i should note, in tier 2 nearly all bus routes receive a frequency boost, one that makes their rush hour schedule the all day schedule. To simplify it, this puts routes into two categories: 15 minute routes and 30 minute routes. What I'm talking about here is getting promoted from a \"30 minute route\" to a \"15 minute route\")",

Its not anywhere near what express routes used to carry pre-pandemic, but the express routes have been hovering around 200-300 riders per day, and thats worrying because thats not good performance, and DART may not be able to justify keeping them running with those numbers. This is a sign of recovery on the express routes though, so I'm glad. ",

I save 30 min each way with relying on my scooter then the bus.\n\nThis works double once I get off work. I can either wait on the 227 (which is late 3 out of 5 days a week) and hope the bus gets to the TRE in time or ride my scooter to the TRE. My e scooter is more reliable every-time. \n\nWatch some YouTube videos about Unagi Scooters or rent a scooter in Downtown Dallas to see for yourself, but the e scooter ride is way better then the bus.\n\nNo regrets.",

I used to tap to pay with my watch, but a few moths ago I got some flak from a fare enforcer. I got on at Pearl/Arts after tapping with my watch, fare enforcement got on either at Pearl or Cityplace (I believe Cityplace), and when he got to me he asked for my ticket and got frustrated when I said I had done tap to pay with my watch. He didn't believe me that it was possible to tap to pay with a smartwatch, but walked away since he had no Internet, but said he'd come back once he had Internet. I left at Mockingbird without him checking, and heard him saying something when I left, but didn't catch it. At least he knew tap to pay was a thing.\n\nAlso, there was another time a fare enforcer didn't know the tap to pay card was a thing.

I\u2019ve found it stated on wikipedia and other places that any city adjacent to serviced cities can hold the voter referendum to levy the tax and join, but I haven\u2019t found any primary source legislation confirming that the cities need to be adjacent. I believe it could be that it\u2019s inherited from this state law, but I\u2019m not totally sure:\n\nhttps://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/TN/htm/TN.452.htm\n\nI would appreciate any help on this, thank you!",

Yes, but only for limited shuttle services. If they're not kicking in a full 1% sales tax, it doesn't make fiscal sense for existing DART member cities to essentially subsidize service to (mostly) affluent suburbs.",

Basically, it doesn't benefit current cities to provide service to say Prosper since they would spend a lot of money and degrade service just to bridge the distance. And if a city is getting poor service they may decide to leave, which opens the door to other cities leaving with them",

        "selftext": "The Dallas news covered the story, and did a very good job. If you wanna check it out, you can [click here](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/transportation/2023/09/27/dart-board-approves-18-billion-budget-for-2024/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere was a lot of debate about the budget, and it only passed 8-5. Almost everything the DART board votes on passes unanimously, and this budget was VERY contested. A lot of board members did not like the budget staff presented.  \n\n\nWhat did I think of the budget DART staff presented? Its fantastic, easiest yes vote of my life (if I were a board member)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's a rough summary of what the budget does:\n\n* gives is our first route with 10 minute headways (besides 883 east), the very crowded Route 22 (well a segment of it, but still)\n* improves light rail frequency on weeknights (30 min to 20 min from 6pm to 10pm)\n*  continues funding for boosted security. \n* adds new bus routes, extends existing bus routes, reconfigures bus routes in a way that makes more sense. \n* $50 million on bus shelters (upgrades will be complete by 2028), adds 250 next gen bus shelters, 455 next gen benches, 300 lights\n   * I think \"next gen\" here just means a new bench/shelter that's not the same as what DART has been building\n* Funds continued planning and design for plans to speed up 22 bus corridors\n* Develops a new East Dallas transit hub (ngl i have no idea what this is but sounds cool)\n* Continues silver line construction\n* Funds new Brandt trucks to quickly move malfunctioning trains\n   * and new catenary maintenance vehicles to speed up maintenance of the overhead wires\n   * all of this seems to lessen the impact of delays\n\n&#x200B;\n\nANYWAYS, its a very good budget. If you notice, a lot of issues people have with DART are at least partially addressed with this budget.  \n\n\nWhy was this budget so controversial then?  \n\n\nTo start, there is this fund DART has called the MAIF. Every year, DART has to predict how much sales tax revenue they will receive. They then budget below that prediction just to be safe. Almost always, the budget is less money than they receive in sales tax. The remaining money goes into this fund called the MAIF.   \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0gfjfphtiarb1.png?width=568&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec6ed2404250ff0cb0844b6f40db3b0a9d1f8a0c\n\n  \nThis chart shows that DART does a pretty good job budgeting just below what they actually receive. As a result, the MAIF fund has grown and has over $100 million. That is your tax payer and fare revenue dollars though.  \n\n\nSo you know what would be cool? If DART spent the money, instead of sitting on sales tax dollars. They plan on spending $5 million a year, for 20 years, on GoLink. The decision to fund GoLink is somewhat arbitrary, if not GoLink these funds would be used on something else in the budget. In theory, this zeroes out the MAIF in 20 years. In reality though, this year alone DART is going to add an additional $15 million to the MAIF. This means that even though DART is taking from this fund every year, it may actually grow or stay the same (we really can't know)  \n\n\nA lot of board members did not like staff's plan to use the MAIF like this. These board members said that DART should find that $5 million from \"somewhere else\"  \n\n\nWhere that somewhere else is, they didn't make any suggestions. Could be from the security everyone wants more of, could be from the bus service they want to add. The very GoLink service its funding. I have no idea.  \n\n\nhe reason they don't want to use the MAIF in this way is because some better hypothetical use for the money (that doesn't currently exist) could come up one day. Its important to remember though, that DART revisits its budget every year. If such a scenario were to occur, they could always look at the MAIF again and rebalance the budget. Until someone else has any better ideas though, I say DART uses this money instead of letting tax payer money sit and do nothing.  \n\n\n  \nWhile I did find the MAIF discussion annoying, that is not the worst part. DART has been discussing this budget for months, staff has been presenting it to the board, and during this time, the board has had plenty of opportunities to chime in, state their opinions, discuss if the budget is too high or too low.  \n\n\nSo, on the DAY the DART board has to vote for the budget, an ammendment is proposed to cut $25 million from the operating budget. Mark Enoch (Represent's Garland And Rowlett on the board), who I generally like and generally seems to believe in transit and the potential it has, said that the growth to the budget was unsustainable.  \n\n\nThen there was Paul Wagemen (One of Plano's reps) who said that we are going in the wrong direction, criticizing all this spending when ridership is declining....  \n\n\nExcuse me? This man sees the same board meetings I do. He should know damn well ridership is growing and growing pretty well. We are getting closer and closer to pre-pandemic ridership by the month. Weekend ridership has SURPASSED prepandemic levels. DART's ridership recovery has honestly been pretty good, I made this chart to prove it:  \n\n\n(the vertical axis is the % of pre-pandemic ridership that month had, August 2023 had 76% of August 2019 ridership, but at the start of the pandemic DART had less than half of its riders) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xi993maamarb1.png?width=1105&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca2ae5687bc948885f7d0356a5928a04cd8b983f\n\nThis sudden amendment that was proposed to cut $25 million at the last hour was really annoying. But thankfully, the amendment failed, and the budget passed as is.\n\n  \nI also don't buy the argument that the budget was unsustainable. I mean why bring it up now? And as my graph showed, DART has a history of budgeting below the budget predictions (which are pretty accurate) and is continuing to do that in 2024. Inflation increased costs a lot, but we have record sales tax.  \n\n\nAnyways, the board argued over the budget until 10 pm. I was there with others to make a public comment, but I had to make a post about this.  \n\n\nOh and no way im proof reading this so sorry for any typos.",

Now I believe it's 75% ridership, 25% coverage.\n\nTheir fixed route service, frequency improvements fall under ridership. GoLink falls under service. So, for DART to be say, increasing frequency or adding bus service, thst typically counts as an investment in ridership. GoLink is coverage.\n\nSo as we work towards tier 2, which is a huge frequency investment (ridership), it makes sense for them to invest in GoLink (coverage)\n\nIt should also be noted that tier 2 is a much larger investment in light rail and bus service than what they plan for GoLink.

DTS was formed when privately owned transportation companies were consolidated. \u00a0In addition to municipal bus service, DTS also managed Surface Transportation, Inc., or Surtran. \u00a0**Formed in 1972, Surtran was a joint venture between the City of Dallas and the City of Fort Worth and was designed to provide a link between D/FW Airport and the two cities.** Surtran controlled the exclusive rights to pick-up passengers from D/FW and deliver them to hotels and convention centers in the D/FW area. \u00a0In 1981, the City of Fort Worth ended its association with Surtran, leaving Dallas as Surtran's sole municipal support. \u00a0\u200bDue to falling revenues and increased debt, the City of Dallas declined to continue funding Surtran, resulting in its closure. \u00a0On October 31, 1985, Surtran ceased operations. \u00a0\u00a0  \n>  \n>Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) was created in 1983 as a regional replacement for DTS when 58% percent of voters in 14 Dallas County cities cast ballots in favor of a one-cent \u00a0local tax to help fund regional transportation. \u00a0Revenue from the voter approved funds as well as investment income, fare revenue, and other sources fund the operation and continued development of DART's transit system plan. \u00a0DART opened the first modern light rail system in the Southwest in 1996.\n\n\\---\n\nAs others have commented on the [Would Collin County, DFW growth support a rail, regional transportation?](https://www.reddit.com/r/dart/comments/16rqsbg/would_collin_county_dfw_growth_support_a_rail/) thread, it's hard to justify the cost of additional rail in Collin County (other than extending the Red Line to McKinney). I'm not saying rail will never be justified, but Frisco-McKinney is simply too sprawled. IMHO, it would take at least a generation of aggressive de-sprawling before rail makes sense.\n\nPark & ride to a bus rapid transit feels silly, but with 5-minute headways (like what was seen in 1974), it would be incredibly convenient for anyone. I hope the next generation of park & rides are NOT primarily for car parking; I'd love to see car parking replaced with [modern bicycle lockers](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-20/how-the-dutch-investment-in-bike-parking-paid-off). A comprehensive bicycle network is justified for any amount of sprawl. The combination of BRT + micro transit (e.g. GoLink) + bike infrastructure form a powerful trifecta.",

They're not so low density that transit is completely unfeasible, but in the near term true dart membership is unfeasible. There are a few individual potential rail lines that seem promising (red line extension to Mckinney, a DNT line, a Frisco-Irving line), but the density is far too low outside these individual lines to add connecting busses (but a lot of it is perfect for bike lanes.) True DART membership would be problematic, but something similar to Trinty Metro could work (albeit far more integrated to DART.) A small advantage to bedroom communities is that its stroads are really easy to make bike friendly. In say Frisco, the only stroads that are genuinely difficult to make bike friendly are Preston, Eldorado, and the highways.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I hope the next generation of park & rides are NOT primarily for car parking\n\nHonestly yeah. There's still a place for car park and rides in the future (parker road is a park and ride I'm happy keeping as is), but too many of our stations are car park and rides. I'd be surprised if you told park and riding had a significant role to play in driving ridership in Mockingbird station despite them having 700 parking spaces. I have nothing against park and rides existing, but DART provides enough parking for nearly 20k cars which is ridiculous. We're a transit agency, not a parking agency.",

        "selftext": "I\u2019ve been thinking alot recently about good station & bad station placement and design. Most of our stations simply have either bad placement, or bad design about integration into the surrounding areas. Some of the things I\u2019ll talk about in this post are mostly outside of DART\u2019s control, however DART can still influence action on them. Ultimately, these issues are (mostly) relatively minor, but can add up to make taking the train a far less than ideal situation.\n\nI think [Walnut Hill Station](https://www.google.com/maps/@32.8828942,-96.7644773,281a,35y,23.92h/data=!3m1!1e3!5m1!1e2?entry=ttu) on the Red & Orange lines is one of the better placed stations. Walnut Hill Station straddles Walnut Hill Ln, which is something most stations do not do. Because it straddles the road it passes over, it enables passengers to safely and easily get to the side of the road that they need, or get to the station without having to cross a 6 lane road. It has both elevators and stairs on both sides of Walnut Hill Ln, making access and accessibility a breeze. This makes getting on the train from this station incredibly convenient no matter which side of the road you are coming from, saving you potentially 5+ minutes of walking out of your way to the nearest safe crossing, waiting for traffic lights, and then crossing and doubling back. It also has a direct walking path from the station to Presby.\n\nThe station isn\u2019t perfect, however. The sidewalk infrastructure around the area is also absolutely atrocious, especially considering it\u2019s a main link to the medical facilities next to the station. [If you look here,](https://www.google.com/maps/@32.8828025,-96.7645324,3a,75y,221.19h,77.12t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1swdWXNNI17sK__ASImUMYUw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) you will see how to continue walking along Walnut Hill, you have to cross this slip lane for cars, with no marked crossing or crossing ramp. [And parts of the sidewalk](https://www.google.com/maps/@32.8829317,-96.7645445,3a,75.8y,284.43h,80.44t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sHQntkOxuKaspnnmkscjjvA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) are overran by utility poles and boxes, making it a tight squeeze, especially if you have a mobility device (which is more likely here given the nearby medical facilities at Presby). Fortunately for Walnut Hill Station, with the new transit oriented development and improvements coming to the area, some of it's issues will have an opportunity to be resolved in the near-term.\n\nDespite it\u2019s flaws, Walnut Hill Station is just plainly better located than the station that is just south of it - [Park Lane Station.](https://www.google.com/maps/@32.8722785,-96.7656744,234m/data=!3m1!1e3!5m1!1e2?entry=ttu) Park Lane Station was not built straddling Park Ln, but instead built adjacent to it despite being elevated. This makes crossing the Park Ln an exhausting affair when coming or going from the station. In order to cross you have to walk a bit to the nearest intersection, while cars whiz by at 40+MPH inches away from you, wait on a tiny corner for the pedestrian crossing signal, and then finally cross. If Park Lane Station straddled the street like Walnut Hill Station does, that would make trips to the area far more comfortable and safe.\n\nAdditionally, despite being right next to a strip mall and a more pedestrian oriented shopping complex, there\u2019s no convenient access to either of them. The pedestrian infrastructure in this area is atrocious as well - though in my opinion far worse than Walnut Hill Station. [Sidewalks are narrow](https://www.google.com/maps/@32.8720133,-96.7666505,3a,75y,88.19h,80.01t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s588y3rGp2UlobdG6ibXxvw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192!5m1!1e2?entry=ttu) and made worse with utility poles in the middle of the sidewalk. In order to get to the transit adjacent walkable development Shops At Park Lane (that should not be called transit oriented development), [you have to cross Park Lane at Caruth Plaza](https://www.google.com/maps/@32.8720149,-96.7672817,3a,75y,230.08h,76.69t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sk4f7LlZU1aqzrZaV0qda9g!2e0!7i16384!8i8192!5m1!1e2?entry=ttu), then double back and cross an exit lane to get to the complex.\n\nAnd that\u2019s to say nothing of the fact that if Park Lane Station straddled Park Lane (and with some appropriate traffic calming from the City of Dallas), you could have buses that pass through the station (like Route 20) stop on either side of Park Lane without having to turn into a station parking lot. This can shorten trip times and save money in the long run as well.\n\nThere are ways Park Lane Station can be improved. Some like sidewalk improvements or traffic calming are pretty dependent on the city, but DART could build a pedestrian bridge across Park Lane, similar to what was done at [Downtown Carrollton Station.](https://www.google.com/maps/@32.9537968,-96.9072146,3a,75y,264.77h,96.56t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sXQqtDQs5f9BpZ-SduSJp0Q!2e0!7i16384!8i8192!5m1!1e2?entry=ttu) Another thing DART can potentially do is work with the city to improve the sidewalks there. \n\nImproving the access and infrastructure around stations makes taking transit that much easier and more convenient. There are far worse stations than Park Lane (such as Arapaho Station), and many of the problems with Park Lane can be seen in other stations like Royal Lane or Spring Valley Stations. That said, if DART can resolve some of these annoyances of walking to the train station, it makes it that much easier to ride.",

                "body": "I think perhaps the greatest struggle I've been dealing with, emotionally, is whether or not I should even try with this state, and with this Metroplex, at all. There's many points for both sides, and I certainly admire anyone who's been willing to or is still willing to put up with the nonstop backlash that this state throws at us transit advocates on the daily, but I also 100% respect those who've just had enough and need to go somewhere that will actually support them.\n\nFor the time being, I believe I'm going to be staying in Frisco (mostly for reasons unrelated to transit, but still) and so long as I'm here, I'm going to keep doing my part in advocating for change wherever possible. However, if the time comes where I *can* leave, I'm really not sure of if I'll go or not... Texas has so much potential in it, but it's buried under thousands of feet of red tape, redlining, and conservative politicization of the \"freedom\" of car dependency. I won't lie, living in a state like this can be damn disheartening. Even during the times where I feel like the suggestions I make are popular or at least supported by a pretty vocal group of advocates, I also feel just the monolithic and near-unchanging attitude of the suburbs of Dallas (which yes, I'm calling Frisco a suburb, don't @ me).\n\nAt the end of the day, I'm advocating for transit in a place that's *proud* of how inaccessible it is to people without cars. Some in the city frequently remark at how pleasant it is to not have the \"riff raff\" here, completely unaware that their absence isn't caused by anything actually GOOD that the city has done! It's an interestingly backwards, violently rich subset of these United States... I try where I can, but sometimes I wonder if my effort really would be better spent elsewhere, you know? But then that gets into the whole problem of how even if I am able to leave this place one day, not everyone is, and don't those people deserve transit just as much as anywhere else?\n\nThe concept of choosing your battles is a difficult one, especially when we aren't really dealing with casualties or resource loss in a traditional sense. Everyone's answer to this question is going to be different, and I totally respect whatever approach anyone here takes, whether they leave or stay. My only issue is when someone declares a place a \"lost cause\" like I know a *certain someone* in the transit community has done in context to the entirety of North America. I know places like Texas aren't totally lost causes, like even look at the high speed rail project between Dallas and Houston! That is HUGE! \n\n...But of course, for every victory, however minor, I'm brought back down to Earth by the many questionable policy decisions of this state's finest. Like a few weeks ago I wrote to my congressman to show my support for the federal grant that Amtrak is supposed to be getting, which many in the House were trying to cut significantly. I got his written response this week, which essentially boiled down to him saying \"I TOTALLY am all for the rail industry, yes yes. However, I don't want these big city LIBERALS getting TEXAS TAX DOLLARS to fund their stupid trains. Amtrak needs to improve their service before I give them more money.\" Very stupid, I know, but the unfortunate problem is that so many people unironically think like this. They somehow expect a transit agency as horribly treated as Amtrak to just pull itself up by its bootstraps and spawn in all the service fixes needed BEFORE they're given any extra money... \n\nI'm sorry for essentially writing an essay here, but all this is to say that I do not blame you one bit for making a tactical retreat here. Odds are you'll be much happier in a place that at least somewhat acknowledges transit as a viable option, and I hope that whatever form of advocacy you do there ends up benefiting the people of Chicago and beyond for the better! Good luck out there and I hope that someday we can bring Texas back to a point where you may even want to live here again :)",

A person on the call complained about the service disruptions to DART especially recently, and Nadine mentioned that they hadn't announced it yet, but they were going to meet soon with Rep. Allred and his staff about a system modernization package with improvements that should increase system reliability as well as system speeds. She didn't mention specifically about weatherization for heat (or cold), but given that the recent delays the person was complaining about have mostly been heat related, I'd say it's a safe bet that there is some kind of weatherization plans as well. Hopefully we'll hear some more news soon about this since heat-induced delays have been the biggest problem for DART lately. \n\nAlso, I asked Rep. Allred about supporting alternatives to highways and car-based infrastructure in the region given that personal vehicles are the most deadly form of transportation and the least environmentally friendly, and he basically said Texas is a highway state and supports highways, but also supports alternatives to driving and specifically called out that he's a big supporter of DART.

However, our neighbors saw the money and immediately signed. Was certainly a 'damned if we do, damned if we don't' sort of deal. I'd say the wind turbines were far more disruptive to the natural landscape and light pollution. The horizon at the home I grew up in has a sea of blinking red lights now.\n\nI now am now obligated to further expand this comment to say that I like renewable energy and it is greatly helpful for the environment, just as mass transit can more effectively transport people.

After they received that information, so they could check the car's path, they stated that an officer would be alerted at an upcoming stop. The concerning individual ended up getting off at an earlier stop anyway, which I informed them of, and that was as far as my involvement went. An operator remained in contact via the text system (occasionally asking whether the situation had changed, etc) the whole time. \n\nMy word of advice out of that would be to make sure you've got the train car number ready to send in your first contacting message.

Normally they'll radio for security or police support in a situation like that.

In collaboration with the North Central Texas Council of Governments (NCTCOG), DART has installed electric vehicle charging stations at the Glenn Heights Park & Ride and Illinois Station locations.\n\n\u201cBy bringing these electric vehicle charging stations to an area that doesn\u2019t have this service, DART is implementing sustainable technologies across our service area.\u201d explained Nadine Lee, DART president & CEO. \u201cWe will continue to work with other agencies, stakeholders, and organizations to find opportunities to bring improvements to our riders and communities.\u201d\n\nThe Blink Series 8 Dual Port Level 2 Chargers can charge a typical electric vehicle within 4-8 hours, making it a great option for transit users with electric vehicles to park and charge during the day. The dual charging ports allow two cars to charge simultaneously and are free to use through August 31, 2024.\n\n\u201cWith the purchase of electric vehicles on the rise due to consumer preferences, auto industry trends, and potential requirements set by governing bodies - local governments will have to begin to think about how to make their cities EV ready,\u201d said Keith Moore, Glenn Heights interim city manager. \n\nMoore went on to say that DART\u2019s decision to place EV Charging Stations within the DART Park and Ride located in Glenn Heights sets the city ahead of the curve as they can already provide a convenient charging location for residents, which can also result in significant cost savings over time for drivers. He also expressed that he was \u201cdelighted that DART chose Glenn Heights as one of the first DART cities to provide these services in.\u201d\n\nThe installation of these electric vehicle charging stations was made possible by a $79,472 grant award under the NCTCOG Electric Vehicle Charging Station Call for Projects program using Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) funds.\n\nThese first installations will allow DART to better understand usage, benefits, and costs of the program to inform a broader expansion strategy throughout the DART Service Area.",

        "selftext": "Good evening. You may have noticed over the last couple weeks and beyond, that DART rail has had some extreme delay issues. There's a few reasons for this, which I will go over, and what has recently changed.\n\nAt the beginning of August, a singular, isolated incident with downed catenary at the south tunnel entrance to Pearl resulted in the first of many restrictions: 10MPH between Routh Street, and Houston Street, essentially making the entirety of downtown a 10MPH zone. The speed with which this restriction, and subsequent restrictions, was put in place, guides us to the idea that they were not very well thought out. 10MPH is **one** of three critical blunders we will learn about. The signals downtown are timed out to accommodate trains traveling at roughly 20mph. 10mph is untenable and results in constant stop-and-go behavior leading to several minutes of delay by the time you leave downtown.\n\nThe next two critical blunders stem from a specific day: August 17th. A few reddit posts spawned from this day, and everyone experienced extreme delays, if any service at all. Due to a mixture of very high heat, poor-quality equipment, deferred maintenance, and just plain bad luck, everything that could go wrong *did* go wrong. The catenary between Pearl, Portal (The tunnel entrance), and Deep Ellum, caught fire. The catenary at Bachman was damaged. The SCADA system, which had previously just failed a day or two before, was having intermittent issues. Power substations failed. Finally, *SEVENTEEN* Pantographs were damaged or destroyed. Three more were damaged the following day, bringing us to a total of Twenty damaged pantographs. I can tell you we do not have twenty spare pantographs laying around.\n\nIn response, DART implemented two more specific restrictions in response, in an attempt to prevent further damage. One could argue sending train after train after train through areas with damaged catenary that keeps ripping off pantographs was an exercise in the absolute height of madness, and that simply shutting down the system after the recurring damage would have better results than stranding trains everywhere. But our new management has demonstrated that the new Modus Operandi was to keep trains running, *at all costs,* regardless of potential damage to the system. If this new management is still around in the winter, we can expect similar practices during ice storms and inclement weather.\n\nCritical blunder number **two**: A 24-hour round-the-clock 40MPH speed restriction across the entire rail system, no exceptions, for every train on every line. This in itself is not particularly damning, but combined with the first, and soon mentioned third restriction, keeping a schedule soon became impossible.\n\nCritical blunder number **three**: A 10MPH speed restriction through all interlockings, switches, and junctions. If there's a track switch, a train had to slow down to 10MPH when crossing it, until clear. As well, if crossing from one track to another, for instance at a terminal station, this restriction further lowered to 5MPH.\n\nWith these now three speed restrictions in place, the time it took for a train operator who was obeying the rules would take over 50% longer to complete a trip. Every line now took at least 90 minutes, usually longer.\n\nNow, if every train followed the same restrictions, wouldn't that result in a mostly consistent frequency of train arrivals, with simply a longer journey? In theory. In practice, this stopped happening after about three days. Tired of perpetual delays and no breaks even late into the night, many operators began to simply ignore the speed restrictions and move trains at full speed. This would lead to these faster trains bunching up behind ones still following the lower speed limits. So, you'd have three or four trains of the same line show up one after another, then see nothing for an hour. Everyone had a different idea of how strictly and how closely these new rules ought to be followed. It's also practically unenforceable, with almost the entire mainline being perfect for skirting these rules. Even at times well past midnight, some trains would fly through the system at 65, and then get stuck behind another one doing 10 through every switch. Most likely, your train was somewhere inbetween the extremes of this spectrum.\n\nFinally, on August 29th, these restrictions were changed. All three have been modified, and the new speed limit across the mainline is 50MPH, with switches simply being a 5MPH reduction in speed from their typical speed limit, instead of a flat 10MPH limit. Further, downtown now has a 15MPH limit, versus the previous 10, which can be just fast enough to get through the signals in time, resulting in minimal delay. On top of all that, these restriction are only in effect between 10:00 and 22:00. Early in the morning and late at night, full posted speed is permitted.\n\nThat's it, long and short. The extreme heat broke a lot of equipment, and DART cracked down with a total sledgehammer policy, putting in place poorly thought out, hardly enforceable rules that every operator adhered to in different amounts.\n\nAt the time of posting, there are still some very low 3-digit temps in the forecast. 101, 102, stuff like that. High nineties as well. If this is not exceeded, these new restrictions should stay in place for a while, probably up until we're a lot closer to the State Fair.\n\nTrust me, everyone in Rail Ops was tired of these speed restrictions. The new limits, while still not *great*, are giving us a lot more breathing room. You should notice trains being must closer to their scheduled headways, with delays being significantly minimized.\n\nHere's to cool temps during the fair, and if we're lucky, another new set of management before this year's ice storm.\n\nStay safe.\n\nEdit 1: Fixed typos. Also, the speed restrictions through interlockings appears to be removed entirely, leaving us with a very simple 50MPH speed from 10am to 10pm. I should State we *do* have other speed restrictions in place, but they are either in very limited locations, or were put in place before the heat incidents.",

They were definitely not prepared.\n\n\nWith D2 out of the financial plan (next month hopefully) I hope that can free up some funds for heat proofing the system.\n\nMy question is, why are speed restrictions considered a critical blunder? Is it because the speed restrictions were slower than what was really necessary? If DART could have gotten away with 15 mph in downtown Dallas then going down to 10 mph is a pretty big blunder. Or are the current speed restrictions a better solution that could have been implemented from the start?\n\nEven now, the temperature seems to be not that bad for Texas summers, I know in June/July DART operated full speed, so my best guess is that there is still some damage done they can't operate full speed through.\n\n\nThis was annoying for riders but holy shit I had no idea how and this was for rail operators. You are all legends for what you do everyday and getting us through this heat. \n\nThis was very eye opening and an interesting read.",

Plus, I wanna get a few up to date answers on this.  \nI'm currently a student in Denton with no car who wants to venture more into Dallas this year. Specifically, I have my eyes set on going to the Texas Theater for a film or two in Oak Cliff, and possibly Good Records in Garland. Of course, with having no car and me being alone, I'm a bit nervous about using the transit. The A-Train is easy enough, and I've done the Green and Orange line into DFW Airport, but this time I'm actually venturing more into central/south Dallas. How safe is the transit around 5-7 PM, and just in general? Any advice for getting on the buses and getting off at the DART stations? I know the usual \"keep your head up, be aware of your surroundings at all times, keep track of your stuff, and mind your business\", but is there any other advice that might help me? Any and all advice and comments are helpful. ",

Sounds to me like you've used it off peak, so you know what to expect. 5-7pm isn't too bad at all. The experience you have with the trains already should give you a good idea on what to expect\n\nKeep to yourself, keep track of your stuff. When the train doors are about to open that's probably the most important time to hold onto your stuff. I say all this, but I've never once seen a theft on the train.\n\nGetting on a bus is easy, just make sure you're visible, by the stop, and look at the bus driver. You can even do a little wave of you want. If it's dark out, use your phone's flashlight to be seen.\n\nNow, getting on the bus might be a bit tricky if it's your first time, sounds like your trip requires getting on a bus from elm Street. You want the route 9 (or maybe even the 47 or 109) but there will be a lot of other bus routes that serve your stop. So a lot of buses will be coming by that you DONT want to get on.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dh9spypbazkb1.jpeg?width=432&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=60c843a8a503d81bbbe6c127950f6bb8ecb174cd\n\nThis is an old photo but yeah in downtown Dallas this is what the bus stops look like. So, pay close attention and make sure you haul the correct bus. Once you get used to it, it's really easy. Using these kinds of bus stops with all these routes is a bit intimidating when you're new though, but do it enough times and you'll be a pro.",

The main practical difference is Route 9 stops directly on Jefferson Blvd, while Routes 47 and 109 stop a block away. Those are safe streets to walk for last leg. All three routes share the same stops on Elm Street, so as soon as you step off the train, you can walk over to any bus stop on Elm Street and hop on whichever arrives first.\n\nRosa Parks Plaza is the most visible of the bus stops on Elm Street. GoPass & Google Maps often recommend a rather inconspicuous bus stop because it's technically a shorter walk from the station. But I recommend walking the extra 1 minute to board from the plaza because you're less likely to be passed by and have light, shelter, shade, and places to sit.\n\nThe sheer quantity of routes on a single bus stop can be overwhelming to first-timers -- it's not so overwhelming once you realize only Elm Street and Commerce Street are like this. These two streets form a one-way couplet (two parallel one-way streets that act like one big two-way road).\n\nY'know how every train line passes through a single downtown trunk? The buses do the same thing: Elm+Commerce is the trunk all downtown buses pass through (the only exception is Route 1 and the express buses). Elm St is eastbound on the trunk, and Commerce St is westbound on the trunk. This is why you can board any of your buses from Elm St and why there are so many routes per stop.",

I've honestly never had an issue while riding the buses. It's the most gentrified part of Oak Cliff and easily the safest. The last two times, I've had women in my group, and we were walking outside between the restaurants and the bus stops close to midnight each time. Never a sketchy moment. The only somewhat tense moment on Jefferson Blvd was when u/cuberandgamer and I were waiting at a bus stop, and a middle-aged woman randomly started yelling obscenities at us in what I can only guess was a psychotic episode. That encounter turned out to be a win for safety in my book because there were other people on the street and at the bus stop to back us up (safety in numbers). When the bus arrived and we explained what was happening, the operator shut the door before the deranged woman could get on (bringing cheers from us all).\n\nRoute 9 is your top choice as it's high frequency and drops you directly onto Jefferson Blvd. But the 47 and the 109 work just as well; it's a pleasantly short walk from their bus stops.\n\n**Blue Line to Downtown Garland**\n\nEverything northeast of SMU/Mockingbird Station on the Blue Line are sleepy suburbs. If you've graduated beyond the discomfort of being around poor people, there's nothing exceptional to worry about when riding the Blue Line to Garland.\n\n**Transferring in Downtown Dallas**\n\nI use the term \"graduate\" because that's how I really see it. The West End is a highly stimulating environment. A lot of the fears and discomfort people have ultimately come down to just knowing what to expect and growing thick skin with time and exposure to urban life's sights, sounds, and smells.\n\n\"Shady people\" are often just unhoused individuals existing in public, nothing more. They're often just randomly staring out into space like anyone else would in their downtime; they just happen to be unshowered in tattered clothes as they do.\n\nThree tips:\n\n* The mindset I encourage is \"don't take it personally when you witness humanity.\" Case in point, people often cite seeing someone arrested as evidence a place isn't safe when really it's evidence of the opposite. My theory is we tend to attach to what we see. Worse things happen behind closed doors; learn to detach from what happens publicly.\n* When solicited for money, you can politely say *\"Sorry, I don't give money to strangers.\"* I like this approach because it allows me to humanely acknowledge the other person (as opposed to rudely pretending they don't exist) while protecting my boundaries. Plus, sometimes people will linger until you say something, so they move on after I say this. On rare occasions when someone is persistent, I can firmly repeat *\"Sorry, I said I don't give money to strangers.\"*\n* These two tips help build internal confidence and project it in your body language. Confidence is an effective deterrent to actual risk; if you have a bullet-proof mind, it'll show.",

It's not too bad, it takes you right to the baggage claim.\n\nHowever, I don't see DART re-aligning the green/orange line. It would be nice, but probably too expensive. You could always try to launch some effort to campaign for DART to do this, but doing it within the current constraints of their budget is not ideal, it would come at a significant sacrifice to other things they have going on.\n\n\nYour best bet would be to get the funding from some other government... Like maybe the state or possibly the city (I doubt Dallas would pay for it)\n\nThat would be really really hard. I recommend using the route 5, it's short, quick, frequent, beats driving and parking.",

Funding rail, especially tunneled rail, is expensive and the (free!) bus works well enough. DART and Love could work harder at advertising it though.

Better frequency would be nice, but also more of their late night trips should go all the way to union station. Many of their last few trips just go to west Irving or centerport (around there)",

Silver Line is about to become the dedicated way for Collin and Rockwall counties to get to the airport without a car (and I don't disagree), but the rest of the metroplex needs the same thing.\n\nWhen I was visiting Tokyo, I landed in Narita Airport, which is a considerable distance away from downtown Tokyo. Now, you could take several different trains using the metro system to get there, or you could use a larger, faster train called the Narita Express to go straight to Tokyo and it only stopped at like 4 or 5 major spots. It was more expensive, but it was bigger and faster.\n\nTRE *could* and *should* be that system. It used to have its place as the only rapid transit between Dallas and Fort Worth, but this is not the case anymore. With DART and T-Metro, you can take a much longer, but still connecting route. Right now this doesn't matter too much, but *eventually* when enough of the older generations are gone and Millenials and Gen Z take the political reins, Arlington WILL be dragged kicking and screaming into the rapid transit future- it is just a matter of time. What that means is that there will likely be other trains going east-west (ideally along the old US 80 corridor), so TRE will need to do something to ensure it remains the rapid transit spine of DFW and doesnt become a dinosaur.\n\nWhat needs to happen is this- TRE needs to upgrade to lighter, faster trains, not with a focus of getting to the opposite city, necessarily, but getting from a respective downtown to Centerpoint Station quickly. DFW Airport needs to connect a high-ish capacity people mover to get people from Centerpoint to the southern terminals, probably constructed down the middle of Amon Carter Blvd. Some may disagree, but I think, pragmatically, that is the best thing TRE can do for its future.",

Also the seats closer to the windows have mis-proportioned arm rests that are uncomfortable.\n\nI don't know if TRE will ever get new trains but they could improve the ones they have now by maintaining the HVAC systems on a schedule. Secondly it would be more costly but maybe replace the seating system. The aisles must be a certain dimension because of handicap access or something, but maybe they could narrow the aisle seat a bit to compensate?\n\nWhen the existing fleet goes end-of-life they should just buy the same trains that TexRail and the Silver Line have. Those are more comfortable to ride in. Just make sure the lavatories work unlike TexRail which doesn't seem to keep them open.",

So then I tried to look it up and there's lots of stuff online about DART expansion and TexRail but there's no mention of ever using this route for commuter type rail. Usually there's some kind of 20 year horizon plan that talks about potential - it seemed weird that a corridor that has so much stuff near it would be off the radar.

A lot of DART'S bus changes they have made recently come directly from public comments. Trinity Metro is still run by people and people can always be swayed. \n\nThe Dixon circle neighborhood is getting bus service next year, after asking for it at the board meetings. UTD students are seeing increased 883 east frequency after asking for it. Richardson city council kept asking Nadine Lee for increased service span for more morning/late night trips after the community asked them for it (and nothing's official yet but it's likely the silver line will run later into the night than originally planned)\n\nAnd this is all DART, we don't know Trinity Metro as well.

In doing so, I saw every station and which ones were the most popular. I questioned the route and its infrequent service north well before my trip across the orange line. However, upon riding it I noticed it was very empty until we reached downtown, but then became empty again once we reached Parkland station. So I came up with 2 ideas as possible changes. Apologies for the rough lines I drew these pretty fast.\n\nI'm mostly posting for some thoughts and discussions about this idea. I am well aware that the likelihood of either happening is 0.\n\n[ \\(This one is second, I don't know how to make a post like this\\) Alternatively, A future extension to the east I believe would be ideal, but that one is even less likely to happen than my initial Oak Cliff idea. ](https://preview.redd.it/och11p96vyib1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e5bd004061c21f41e75b5b8d4919c36ea6f1b932)\n\n[ \\(this one is first, I'm not sure how to make a post like this\\) This is a North-South line that I believe would be possible given DARTs' current infrastructure. Being that I noticed people downtown traveled to Parkland\\(which are most likely people from south Dallas who intended to transfer to orange\\/green\\), this would allow an easier connection for those from South Dallas going to Parkland or DFW, those from downtown\\/east Dallas can take the Green line\\(and switch to orange if going to DFW\\), and those who live along the orange line can switch at many more points with every line. I chose the southern red line route because I believe more people live there who ride DART\\(from experience the red line has more passengers than any other line on my average trips\\). This would also help alleviate train traffic downtown.](https://preview.redd.it/lhgqhxy3vyib1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=664f5829a1b7a912f76960aa5a6e61804720ac84)",

While this data is prepandemic, this mostly applies today. This is a infographic made by Patrick Kennedy  \n(source here: [https://www.dmagazine.com/urbanism-transportation/2016/09/some-dart-rail-ridership-infographics-for-fun/](https://www.dmagazine.com/urbanism-transportation/2016/09/some-dart-rail-ridership-infographics-for-fun/))  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/smxc2uyiyyib1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddc728fe5c4e0ecb15b0abe00940696514f7fe0e\n\n  \nThe way this graphic works is the bigger the circles, the more ridership that station see's.\n\nNow all of these circles are smaller right now due to the pandemic, maybe about 25% smaller, but the popular ones are still popular, the unpopular ones are still unpopular.   \n\n\nBut the orange line provides crucial capacity relief on the red line today. Without the orange line, that stretch of the red line would face some intense crowding problems, particularly when there's a delay. And this would only get worse as we recover more and more ridership from the pandemic.  \n\n\nIts still cool to think about different alignments though. I'd love if DART could figure out ways to run north south lines that skip the downtown transit mall.",

I'm pretty sure most of the stops are around neighbors, University of Dallas, and the DCTA transfer point so most traffic would be heading to the UD/ people going to/from downtown. However considering the distance from downtown, and how you mentioned that there's often a long wait, people from North West Dallas are probably more inclined to drive rather than take transit. For that area to become popular honestly it needs better service times, faster operating speeds, and more bus connections. This one is more personal preference but they should really straighten out the orange line as much as possible the 90\u00b0 turn hurt to look at.",

A problem dart has in general, is that the rail stops are rarely at the destination. You usually need to take a bus and a long walk to get there, and this is especially a problem with the orange/green lines. Love field station for example is a 30 minute walk from it's namesake airport. \n\nAs for orange line from downtown to Parker road, I've seen it very busy at certain hours. It's not consistently busy, but during rush hour and near 10pm it's packed. Elsewise, whenever I've been, it's pretty empty",

But I do agree about the stop location problem. A few examples when I did make it to DFW I had to walk a while before I could go inside, then there's other's like the zoo where you have to cross a road to reach the entrance, UNT is pretty far from its own station, and Parkland's bus stops are pretty far from the stairs that lead you to the actual station. I did go to parkland station today and I had to walk pretty far to reach the stairs and I barely caught my train. I don't think there's much dart can do about how close their stations are though. I imagine they work with the spaces they're given since most places expect the majority of their customers to arrive via car. Love field has a shuttle bus that links the station to the airport but I agree the fact that you can't just walk to the place the station is named after is silly.\nAnother comment showed the usage of each stop and yeah the northern Red-orange line stretch is among the busiest in the system.",

I personally had a similar problem with the D2 subway plan because of the intent to make the green and blue lines U shaped because it would also force more people to switch lines. Although, maybe the plan could work if the loop around downtown was very big I'd love it if rail extended beyond the transit mall(the part of D2 I liked)",

Here's the challenge: virtually all the urban rail systems to emerge in North America since the mid-20th century -- including DART -- have relied on abandoned freight lines. This abandonment accelerated during the final quarter of the 20th century due to the rise of containerized freight sorted at remote intermodal ports. This abandoned ROW has been almost entirely hub-and-spoke, hence, a lack of crosstown routes.\n\nThe only solution I see would be some sort of rapid transit circling the city along the Loop 12 corridor, ideally beginning with a link between the red and blue lines, then the green, etc. Platform candidates could include LRT and BRT. While generally favorable to BRT, the devil would be in the details. I really haven't seen the quality of BRT in the US that I see in places like Brazil and Columbia, with elevated tracks and that sort of thing. In the US, BRT has been dumbed down to the point it seldom out-maneuvers congested traffic.",

Some people have had their hopes and dreams crushed, and honestly, thats understandable.  \n\n\nHowever, the last thing I want people to do is to be so harsh against leadership, because there are good reasons for not doing D2 right now.

Its very easy to use the word \"cancel\", and I may have used it myself, but thats not really true. DART has to adhear to their 20 year financial plans, and if D2 is in it that puts huge restrictions on how they can allocate funds.

There's new routes on Forest, Legacy, Royal, and Story road in this map.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo Christof Spieler points out here, that not doing D2 now lets DART improve frequency due to the extra financial capacity  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gxprdnbnwrib1.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=be6f34a8b37f54c16466fe3519e4bc182baa53eb\n\n  \nAnd Jarret Walker, who runs the human transit blog had this to say  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gi6n33k4xrib1.png?width=639&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d72756754e850f2d6eb952e0b77ce3ce9ed84d3\n\n  \nBut its really not so much of a cancellation as it is a \"we will do it later\"  \n\n\nMaybe to you, 15 minutes isn't good enough. However, it should be noted we got confirmation from head of service planning (learn more here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/dart/comments/14wcvsa/increasing\\_frequency\\_without\\_d2\\_signal\\_priority/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dart/comments/14wcvsa/increasing_frequency_without_d2_signal_priority/))  \n\n\nWe can get up to 10 minute headways on LRT without D2 (but with other upgrades)  \n\n\nGoing beyond 10 minutes, would require a second alignment downtown.  \n\n\nNow, i think these are all reasons to do D2 later. Its not needed right now, because we can expand capacity in other ways, and we are not at prepandemic levels of ridership yet (though, we are getting there)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut what is a reason to NOT delay D2? It comes down to reliability. If there is an incident downtown, it can impact all 4 rail lines and cause system wide delays. That's not to say there aren't ways to be proactive in preventing these delays, but D2 is the most surefire way to improve the reliability. This is a fair point, and I have to take the L on that one. For me personally though, the pros outweigh the cons and I believe that D2 should be done later.  \n\n\nI hope that, at the very least, this has changed how you feel about someone who may choose to delay D2. You may still disagree with the decision, that is okay, but I want the main takeaway of this post to be that the decision to remove D2 isn't a bad one, and it is a decision that can be made with the most sincere intentions. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf it were me, I would have made the same decision DART did. And I probably don't need to prove to anyone how much I want transit/DART to succeed.",

You're awesome. \n\n\nThere's another massive, much more positive DART story. The tier 1 and tier 2 bus networks. I have put a lot of work into covering these, sharing the info, attending public meetings, and creating maps in MS paint. Tier 2 brings massive frequency improvements to the system, reduces transit travel times, and adds new bus routes. It will make DART soo much better when it gets implemented.\n\nI want to encourage you to do your journalistic magoc and publish an official story. There's a lot on this subreddit feel free to use any information you see here as a lead. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/dart/comments/1483c34/recap_post_darts_future_transit_plans_for_those/\n\n^^^ this is probably the best post about the subject \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/dart/comments/1484441/dart_to_make_a_tier_3_transit_network_concept_and/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/dart/comments/15inagx/new_bus_routes_for_tier_2_bus_route_modifications/\n\nTier 1 and tier 2 especially are transformational improvements being made to the DART system that's going to vastly improve the user experience.

[If you look at the bottom of this page,](http://www.arlspectator.mysite.com/rich_text_43.html) you'll find their public email addresses where you can contact them.\n\nSecond, [you can sign our petition here.](https://www.change.org/p/implement-a-public-transit-system-in-arlington-texas) Our current goal is to reach 1000 signatures.\n\nAlso, you can help by spreading the message of Arlington Public Transit. Share it wherever you can online and if you want physical items like pamphlets, cards, and flyers, simply request them through [contact@ArlingtonPublicTransit.com](mailto:contact@ArlingtonPublicTransit.com) We'll send you an advocacy kit for free.\n\nNo matter what, I appreciate  anyone and everyone that shows interest in making this happen. It's going to take a large group of interested Arlington citizens, workers and visitors to actually make this vision possible. But public opinion is shifting all over the country as well as here, so there's never been a better time to advocate for public transit.\n\nThe next The Arlington City Council meeting is on September 5th.

This line is way too short, and I believe the bus route it replaced (old D-link) went all the way to uptown. If you're gonna build streetcar don't half ass it, do it right. It should go to uptown.\n\nEdit: I should also mention that this is a very cheap project, pre pandemic inflation I think DART estimated the cost at $46 million because federal grants would pay for the rest. So much cheaper than D2. However, it's far from a priority to me. \n\nGo to Google maps, or gopass. Plan a trip to Bishop arts. Odds are it told you to use one of several bus routes",

Yeah sure, there are other benefits to the project, but it's no longer worth doing until we are closer to needing to do it.

Also, as someone who frequently uses VIA, the experience is just terrible compared to \"real\" public transit like DART or Trinity Metro\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, I totally agree with this statement:\n\n>In order to make public transit better for Arlington, It is going to take the majority of the community at large to make more immediate, direct, and impactful changes\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYes, 100%.

It was a good exercise, though, in getting a sense of scale for the difference in cost between transit and car ownership.\n\nDART is sometimes derided for being a low performing transit system, but it's always compared to other transit systems, not to the car-dependent non-system currently in place. I feel like when advocating for more funding for DART and less car dependency in a place like Dallas, it'd be effective to make arguments in terms of cost. The people who care about the environment and good urbanism already get it, but average joes need to see those numbers.\n\nSo has anyone done a more rigorous comparison they'd like to share?\n\nSpecifically, I think a passenger-mile to passenger-mile comparison is what I'd really be interested in.\n\nEdit: /u/Friengineer helpfully pointed out that air conditioning the bus stops is a dumb idea for a variety of reasons. All good. I'm primarily interested in the cost comparison as things stand, not counting wild ideas.",

Without that separation (i.e. a wall), you're just wasting energy.  Therefore, to provide air conditioning at each bus stop, we must *fully enclose* each bus stop (just like cars).  This is easily five figures per stop.\n* We'll also need power.  Cover that roof in solar panels for another four figures, because running power lines would often be even more expensive.  If we're taking your 1200 watts at face value, that translates to more or less covering a bus stop roof in panels.  Depending on startup power demand, we may need a small battery to supplement.  Add another four figures.\n* Enclosing these spaces introduces all sorts of additional problems, like accessibility, safety/security, and maintenance.\n\nInstead, I'd argue for a simple shade structure with an outdoor fan mounted to the underside (still needs power, but an order of magnitude less).    Simply *moving* air can lower perceived temperature by several degrees, even without conditioning it.  Add in shade, and we can lower local air temperature by 15-20 degrees for a small fraction of the cost of full conditioning.",

        "selftext": "This is a long post, so TLDR at the bottom\n\nWith the tier two bus network I've posted so much about, I'm sure most of you are aware that DART is increasing frequency on its buses. How do they decide which ones to increase though? Well, that's a good question, and I don't have the answer. I do have my own guesses though.\n\nOne may assume the route with the most riders should get a frequency boost. However, this line of thinking is flawed. Here's an example\n\n|Route|\\# of buses required to serve this route|\\# of passengers per day|\\# of miles|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Route A|5|1500|20|\n|Route B|2|1300|13|\n\nAs you can see here, route B, while having a lot less passengers, is far more efficient because it carries close to the same amount of people but with a LOT less buses needed to maintain that routes headways. It also travels a shorter distance. This makes Route B the more efficient route more deserving of a frequency upgrade despite carrying less people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn other words, you don't want to look at total passenger count. You want to look at some measure of efficiency. I'm gonna take a look at the routes with a passenger mile per revenue mile metric greater than 5. This metric tells you how full a route is and accounts for things like length and frequency\n\n(If you want more details on this metric leave a comment, this stuff gets complicated))\n\nJust know, the higher the passenger miles per revenue mile, the more full a bus is.\n\nThat gives us the following routes:\n\n(For the first Quarter btw)(Also, 200 series routes are the less frequent ones, the double digit routes are frequent)\n\n|Route #|Passengers per weekday Q1|Passenger Miles Per Revenue Mile (Fullness) Q1|Getting a frequency improvement in Tier 1?|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|229 (MacArthur-Beltline)|1,477|5.09|Yes|\n|237 (Preston)|921|5.13|No|\n|47 (Polk)|1,461|5.15|No|\n|20 (Northwest Highway)|2,042|5.16|No|\n|230 (Irving Blvd)|1,471|5.20|Yes|\n|241 (Coit)|1,365|5.22|Yes|\n|9 (Jefferson-Gaston)|2,320|5.32|No|\n|38 (Ledbetter)|2,157|5.36|No|\n|22 (Forest Lane)|2,583|5.51|Yes|\n|13 (Ervay)|1,777|5.64|Yes|\n|15 (Buckner)|1,933|5.79|No|\n|18 (Samuell)|1,769|6.48|No|\n|16 (Ferguson)|1,569|6.88|No|\n|57 (Westmoreland)|2,769|7.11|No|\n|239 (NW Plano, Addison, DNT)|1,167|7.27|Yes|\n\nThee route 239,is the route most deserving of a frequency boost by this metric. This makes a lot of sense when you consider how the route 239 is run, it runs through west Plano before going to Addison, and once it hits Addison it gets on the Dallas North Tollway to connect these passengers to uptown/downtown. So people go long distances on it, of course its full.\n\nBut why is the route 57 not getting a frequency upgrade in tier 1? or the route 16, or 18? Yet the route 229 is despite being much less full and carrying less people overall?\n\nMy guess is that it has to do with this:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dvrj3tfk6tgb1.png?width=553&format=png&auto=webp&s=98d8806d80b131685f5dd2de4d5dae12d8adbb22\n\nUsing this example, lets say we have 15 minute headways, suppose we want to improve that to 10 minutes. We need 2 buses, which is fine, but that takes your average wait time for a bus from 7.5 minutes to just 5 minutes. That is certainly an improvement, and improves the convenience of the bus, but not by a lot.\n\nSuppose there is another route that has 60 minute headways. With the example above, improving that to 30 minutes just takes 1 bus. By adding 1 bus, we ***DOUBLE*** the frequency. This improvement (which took less buses in this example) is going to do so much more to improve ridership compared to adding a bus to the already frequent route. A frequency improvement like this improves reliability and wait times to such a huge degree compared to a 15 minute -> 10 minute improvement.  \n\n\nNow, DART's most full bus is already a very infrequent route, so improving the frequency there is a no brainer. But, from this perspective, it also makes more sense to improve the frequency of, say, the 230, over the route 9, even though the route 9 is more full on average. It also makes since that improving the frequency of the route 57 is maybe not the biggest priority even though its their highest ridership non UTD route.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's not to say frequent routes won't get improvements. though. The frequent routes are better candidates a different kind of improvement. Reliability and speed. If I can improve the reliability and speed of the route 57, that helps 2,700 daily riders (in reality, way more. Q1 is a slow quarter for bus ridership) So things like bus lanes or transit signal priority (giving buses the green light) make more sense for these high ridership frequent routes. I could spend those same dollars on say, the 241, but that would only help 1,365 daily riders. Physical infrastructure improvements are better spent on these already frequent routes. Having a fast reliable bus is not that great if I have to wait 40 minutes to get on the damn thing in the first place. That's why the bus corridor improvement program is focusing on the frequent routes, and the service improvements are more geared towards these infrequent overperforming suburban/200 series routes.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; I think there are three factors that decide if a bus gets a frequency boost\n\n1. How full the bus is (the more full, the better candidate it is for a frequency bost)\n2. How frequent it is (the less frequent it is, the more likely they are to want to boost its frequency)\n3. How much resources it takes to improve that frequency to a significant degree(the less resources it takes, the better)\n\nSo, a successful infrequent route is more likely to get a frequency boost than as well performing, as full, frequent bus route.\n\nSources:[https://dart.new.swagit.com/videos/05082018-955/6](https://dart.new.swagit.com/videos/05082018-955/6) (this goes into detail on how DART decides what a routes frequency should be)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/dart/comments/13iu0zd/bus\\_ridership\\_data/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dart/comments/13iu0zd/bus_ridership_data/) (ridership data I used)\n\n&#x200B;",

Its a very successful segment, and I'd imagine this segment, if it was measured separately, would have a passenger per revenue mile way higher than any other DART route. This segment gets really really full, and DART is probably upgrading the headways to 10 minutes because this segment performs REALLY well, so well its worth the money. They might not even have a choice, the route 22 might just be so full they have to improve the headways. Its not hard to see 20-30 people waiting for a route 22 at forest lane station.",

I remember some DART staff mentioning upgrading the 241 being potentially accelerated faster than the Tier 1/Tier 2 upgrades at a public meeting, and I've seen the 232 get decently full for a DART bus (nowhere near standing room only tho) while classes at UTD are in session.",

I'm really curious to see if it can break 1300 or even 1400 this year, if it does then it's probably on par with the other 200 series routes that are going to be given a frequency boost.\n\nI also wonder if the increased frequency on the 883 east will take away some riders from the 232, since now if you just go to a bus stop on the overlap you're more likely to randomly encounter an 883 east.\n\n241 is definitely getting an upgrade at some point. Honestly I'm surprised it didn't happen this year, I guess they wanted to prioritize their route reworks and new routes.",

With that happening (not this year but in the future), hopefully they will be satisfied\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j4x80jgyp7gb1.png?width=1145&format=png&auto=webp&s=698326a4accdb87bbcc82238c15b3ae896c29e7a\n\nThis new configuration replaces the route 240 with routes 244 and a 238 extension (overall its better but RIP people on west campbell, not sure if there were a lot of you but im sure there were a few) Pretty big W for UTD and anyone on that section of Arapaho in Richardson. These changes are pretty sensible IMO. Central Richardson Golink was a terrible performer, and now the 238 makes it redundant.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l51vxc65q7gb1.png?width=779&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0ad22edf7d55bee5949a4e70101452b5b66baef\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis replaces the route 222. I think this looks better overall, route 222 was a strange one. 122 has more frequency, 207 extension fills in the gaps. Good change overall.I can actually look at this map and understand what is going on. You know what I can't do with a route 222 map? That.\n\n[I literally dont know how the route 222 works this is so much more legible](https://preview.redd.it/akm6v3zgq7gb1.png?width=758&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d3bfcfd78c7070943c91d0a46d03257ad3f4d95)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd i mean, this change was just necessary lol. Go here during rush hour and you'll see what I mean. 10 minute headways on this section, which is great. Wish the frequency improvements hit the entire route but still nice\n\n[10 MINUTES LETS GOOOOO](https://preview.redd.it/8x150j7pq7gb1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=78086fe66bec0bb9b4837800320ecfab49a42702)\n\n# September 2024 changes\n\nJust reminding all of you this is happening. God I wish this was a September 2023 change\n\n[WOOOO the change im most excited for tbh](https://preview.redd.it/d1dk5bktq7gb1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb0f2ed6befe8c3c532d0358f41aea30968387d0)\n\nOverall these are great changes. A few might be disruptive to a few passengers, but overall this is just a net increase in bus service and routes that are a bit more direct, make more sense.\n\nThats all the changes for this year.  I got more coming that will not be happening next year, but will still be happening regardless.\n\nTimeline for all of this, and public meetings\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rbhhvgd9t7gb1.png?width=935&format=png&auto=webp&s=22645cc64497dacbdabed0df9928463ac3db925a\n\nSo if any of these changes negatively impacted you, or you want to support them, let them know.",

        "selftext": "If you need some background, these changes build off of some bus route changes coming next year, here is a post about that:  \n[Bus route changes coming next year](https://www.reddit.com/r/dart/comments/15ilj94/new_bus_routes_for_next_year_mapped/)\n\nAnd if you don't know what tier 1 and tier 2 are:\n\n[What is tier 1 and tier 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/dart/comments/1483c34/recap_post_darts_future_transit_plans_for_those/)\n\n  \n\n\nDART released a new map of their tier two bus network. Here it is!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d82wdyoew7gb1.png?width=765&format=png&auto=webp&s=152676eddafc0ee8cc4011e987f13c54c86fbf67\n\n  \nYeah this image is not great, but theres new information compared to the old image we have. And because I spend way too much time staring at bus maps, I was able to find them.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x6sanfbrw7gb1.png?width=1021&format=png&auto=webp&s=31cef743aeec8bf8eea00bdf286b96c8f3f28c48\n\n  \nFirst change I wanna point out, this is the present configuration of the route 227. It dips down to hit forest lane, before going back up to serve Dallas College Brookhaven then ATC. Yeah this is not great, I always stared at the map and just kind wanted to straighten that line and do this:  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n1j3ilwcx7gb1.png?width=1031&format=png&auto=webp&s=878e43ea8aebada238f28107812752bcbde15d8d\n\n  \nThe downside is, that small segment of forest lane loses access to Addison Transit center and brookhaven. But this is probably more useful overall, they get access to the red line and maintain access to the green line.   \n\n\nZooming in on the map, here's the new forest lane cross town route:  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o4e2hreux7gb1.png?width=916&format=png&auto=webp&s=740373356b888cb1ae8444c6e6d88a66611b5b18\n\nExcept on this map, it actually continues into Irving all the way to North lake station on the orange line. It looks like it runs on Royale lane, so that serves Korea town and some employment in Las Colinas. That's fantastic  \n\n\nSo this is an awkward one, I don't know if there's a mistake here or what but   \n\n\nThis is what we have now in the north west plano area:  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z03wutmvz7gb1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=446fe805002db100ff63e17ee2d3feaa442f875a\n\nAnd this is what we will have after the introduction of the route 254 next year:  \n\n\n  \nAnd here's what we will have in the future.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9pefzlyi68gb1.png?width=734&format=png&auto=webp&s=00dfff43ce1f4eefa5a321d777ee87857fbd081e\n\nAs you can see, the route 234 no longer goes up preston to serve legacy, because the route 254 already will be serving legacy. This makes sense, no need to duplicate service. Instead, it just stays on spring creek until it gets close to NW plano Park & Ride  \n\n\nBUT in tier 2, this gets a little goofy:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5n0n49db88gb1.png?width=456&format=png&auto=webp&s=7bd53316dd8ade2e41913b7852f712f5a7f74547\n\nThe 234 just stays on Park blvd. Which would be fine if they added a Spring creek bus route to fill in the gap, but I don't see it. I find that really strange, I feel like a mistake was made, its possible there was supposed to be a Spring creek route or maybe the 234 was drawn wrong here. Or maybe this is all 100% correct, I have no idea.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI may have missed some of the changes made, if you see anything else that looks interesting let us know in the comments.",

Apart from those built beside hwy like Irving Conv Center, UD, Victory or Galatyn, some other stations\u2019 connectivities seem strange, too. Arapaho and Ten 50 are divided by only a wall.

        "selftext": "Two years ago, DART completely shut down in February because of the winter weather. They could not operate, trains, but they didn't operate buses either, and that was apparently a first. It was really bad, transit is like running water or electricity, it's not just something that should just not run on some days.\n\n\nShortly after, those who followed this subreddit for a while might remember a post I made about DART committing to winterizing their infrastructure. Its expensive, but was seen as worth it by many.\n\nThis year, February hits again and we get some really bad winter weather. However, the response from DART changed. They were communicating constantly, staying on top of delays for all the bus and train routes. They did a lot more preparation the day before, and they kept the light rail running. There were lots of problems and delays, but, they kept things going regardless. They were torching the switches, just doing everything they can to keep things together. The system was functional, not as reliable as usual but neither is any other mode of transportation when it gets that cold in Texas.\n\nThen, summer hits this year. We have had so many speed restrictions hit, and today was just awful. Communications system down, speed restrictions due to heat, and a catenary wire meltdown. \n\nThese days where it passes 105 degrees seem to prove tough for DART. Not as bad as the worst days in winter, but that happens once a year in February. This happens throughout the summer. \n\nWe can also talk about how when it gets really hot, everyone is still expected to go to work. But when the roads are frozen, there's much more leeway for many jobs. More businesses close, and companies will tell their workers to stay home (especially those in hybrid schedules)\n\nNot saying DART shouldn't winterize their rail, and who knows, but we've heard more about rail winterization than preparing the system for summer. There needs to be more focus on summer temperatures if it's going to be this bad or worse from here on out. And maybe there is, but that hasn't been communicated to us. They have (so far at least) put more emphasis on the winterization",

That's a human that has to drive in the elements just to get to work to help other people avoid driving in the elements. The agency wants to keep us operating despite the weather, but we operators do not like that idea. All we're doing during ice storms is moving homeless people. When the city shuts down, we should too. Or they need to pay us hazard pay, which- spoiler alert- they currently do not. \n\nAs for the heat, there are mitigation efforts happening. They're painting trouble spots and addressing warps as fast as we call them in, and only restricting us severely over sketchy sections, not throughout.\n\nThe ongoing heat is also causing the overhead wires to sag in some places, so we're stuck going 10 through downtown until that can be fixed. Honestly though, there's only so much slack they can take up. Expect it to be slow until Fair season.\n\nAdding expansion joints is a much bigger process, expensive and time consuming, and it makes the ride much more noisy and rough, so don't expect that to happen any time soon. \n\nWe're supposed to be replacing the fleet in the next 3-5 years, and the new cars should be designed with temperature extremes in mind. Remember, some of our trains are 30 years old, so any extreme weather is going to mess with them. \n\nAnyway, that's a lot of words for 'they are working on it but there's only so much to be done.'

The one day per year DART shuts down, most people are staying home. Finding ways to operate during the extreme heat without delay seems to be more valuable overall. I don't feel safe walking to the DART station when the sidewalks are iced over. However I say this as someone who doesn't work a job that requires me to be in person. Don't know if for example, a nurse who works in a hospital, would have the same opinion.\n\nAnd no hazard pay? It's 1-2 days per year, they can afford some hazard pay.\n\n>Adding expansion joints is a much bigger process, expensive and time consuming, and it makes the ride much more noisy and rough, so don't expect that to happen any time soon. \n\n\nAh gotcha, and I'm sure residential neighborhoods would not like the added noise\n\n>As for the heat, there are mitigation efforts happening. They're painting trouble spots and addressing warps as fast as we call them in, and only restricting us severely over sketchy sections, not throughout.\n\nHas this been happening recently? Because I recently noticed the speed restrictions aren't delaying me nearly as much as they used to. I definitely notice an improvement (now that you point it out lol)\n\n\n\nThat was very informative, thank you! I guess I felt like not as much as being done because they said they will spend $100 million for rail winterization, but you don't see anything for the heat.",

I will definitely be sharing with the subreddit and discord when the time close.\n\n\nOn frequency, they said that due to the constraints within the right of way (I assume bc it shared it with freight) the best frequency they can do is 20 minute headways. And honestly, I'm cool with that. The silver line isn't going to perform as well as the light rail line does, and anything more, while cool, would  be resources better spent on the bus network. 20 minutes for the silver line seems great, especially since it shares track with freight. And really I'd rather them prioritize 10 minute light rail service than boost silver line beyond 20 (but that's just me)\n\nI think 20-30 minute headways would be an acceptable level.

But my default assumption is a low regard for the program because if DART marketing/customer service has the will and resources to man booths and tables and promotional events all over the DART service area promoting the Silver Line (even at Fair Park, which isn't connected to Silver Line, during non State Fair events), why do we never mobility ambassadors actively talking to first-time riders during the biggest events of the year when interest in using transit is at its peak?

I could explained that it was a rail operated by different company. And \u201cYou said it is cancelled today!\u201d So I just replied \u201cThat\u2019s TRE, connecting Dallas and Fort Worth directly.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhy are names of rail in your city so complicated?\u201d\nImao \n\nSo maybe the lowest hanging fruit is to rename all rails by color. \n\nSao Paolo names its rails all by number. Subway for number 1-6 and commuter rail for 7 and above.\n\nEurope cities name subway by number and commuter rail by S or R. Also easy to understand.\n\nWe will have 4 commuter rails in 2026 and all those have their own naming rule. So dart renamed the Cotton belt as Silver to simply the understanding. We are experienced passengers so we know all this but this doesn\u2019t means new passengers, especially travelers do. Even residents in the metroplex cannot distinguish them sometimes. I heard many times passengers on the terminal link van said they want to go to the \u201cTRE\u201d station. Operators knew they meant the Tex Station at B. Possibly for Fort Worth residents they have deeper memories for TRE because this has existed since childhood.",

The TSOs join the agency\u2019s 252 budgeted DART Police Officers and Fare Enforcement Officers (FEO) in ensuring DART riders have a safe and secure experience.\n\n\u201cThe addition of security officers on trains and platforms is just one of many of our ongoing efforts to provide the safest commuting experience for our customers,\u201d said Charlie Cato, DART chief of police. \u201cHaving a visible presence on as many of our vehicles as possible will be an important deterrent to misconduct, and I hope it also demonstrates our continued commitment to our customers to keep them safe.\u201d\n\nThe TSO program is scheduled to be fully staffed by mid-August, but security officers can already be seen patrolling DART vehicles. The project uses Ridership Improvement Funds approved by the DART Board of Directors to improve security, cleanliness, and reliability for riders across the 13 service area cities.\n\nThis program is also part of a series of planned security improvements by DART that riders can expect to see over the next several months, including technology enhancements, physical deterrents, and collaborative partnerships that will improve safety throughout the system.",

Is it all service hours every day?\n* When the loop is running, how are the other lines affected?\n   * Do any lines have different terminals?\n   * Do any lines stop on different platforms?\n\nI observed an example of the last couple of questions while volunteering as a station attendant at Victory Station on Saturday of the TX-OU game.\n\n* The Orange Line never stopped at Victory Station on game day. Only Green Line + TRE came through Victory. Riders must take Green Line north to Bachman Station to transfer to Orange Line.\n* Normally TRE to Fort Worth stops on Track 3, and TRE to Union stops on Track 4. On game day, TRE used only Track 3 for both directions; it never stopped on Track 4. \n\nFor both of these changes, I don't know if it's unique to the TX-OU game or if it's in effect for the duration of the State Fair.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2gybubk9jlcb1.png?width=5782&format=png&auto=webp&s=949cddd73b049b7d7b965f6197ceb2267742b10e\n\n\\---\n\nIDK if it runs every day of the State Fair, but they definitely run the loop on the weekends when travel demand is highest (at a minimum, the weekends of Battle of the Bands and the TX-OU game).\n\nI started [drawing and proposing designs for station billboards](https://twitter.com/hexel_co/status/1679746254060830720). I'm using the State Fair as the catalyst since it's the biggest transit event of the year, but the real objective is to design station material that can be used throughout the year.\n\nDespite running the special event loop during the State Fair for the last decade, I couldn't find an official map or description of the loop using Google. Does anyone have a file or link handy?\n\nAlternatively, does anyone know the event loop well enough that I can draw from your description?\n\nThanks in advance!",

So, the loop exists.\n\nSometimes we have Victory to Lawnview trains as well, but that may have gone the way of the dodo.",

        "selftext": "Overall, I like these changes a lot. I created a mockup in msPaint Route 238 will go on Arapaho instead of belt line between Addison Transit Center and Arapaho center station. This leaves this section of belt line road without service, but thankfully, DART is extending the route 250 from Spring Valley to Addison Transit Center and it will serve this same section of belt line.  \n\n\nSo no service is lost, and bus service is gained on Arapaho.  \n\n\nHere's the current setup:  \n\n\n  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dq063fs7v8bb1.png?width=1105&format=png&auto=webp&s=e53f9506316841d062ac335b6cd5fec216cdc8c7\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \nHere's what I think the changes will look like:  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lnf67wicu8bb1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=93be42e4cf62becb29d8b3c69242fc32f71ac9d2\n\n  \nI like this setup more, what do you all think?  \n\n\n  \nHere's the slide I got the information from:  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3v1f72xuv8bb1.png?width=922&format=png&auto=webp&s=14585ba3981206c61bb20b99c0cfcfc2a0ce8c2f\n\n  \nI didn't want to make predictions on how the 240 would change, or what the 244 will look like, because I just have no idea. Route 244 seems interesting though, this one might do really well, I wouldn't be surprised if it needs a frequency adjustment in the future. UTD has a lot of transit demand and DART isn't really meeting all of the demand, to the point where students get left behind sometimes because the bus is too full. So I wouldn't be surprised of the route 244 is a hit.",

The current Lockwood-Inge route is okay, but Inge is a small street and tends to have a lot of Class C geniuses that pull out of the businesses and block a lane because god forbid they wait their turn for their vehicle to actually fit. Also, making left turns in Richardson is annoying because of how they have their traffic signals configured. \n\nI wonder how they\u2019re going to fit the 250 at ADTC, it\u2019s already crowded especially during peak.

Now I wonder if I have ever been a passenger on your bus lol.\n\nI like the new arrangement but as a passenger, I prefer being dropped off at Arapaho over spring valley station. I just don't like the elevated stations, and Arapaho has that transit center (which is re-opening sometime next fiscal year, along with every other transit center. That should be good news for the bus operators too!) So now on belt line I get dropped off at spring valley. Its simpler, 250 is always beltline now instead of 238 being belt line west of the rail, and 250 being belt line east of the rail.\n\nAnd yeah I remember that change at ATC. I guess they will just put more buses on the curb. Maybe Addison needs an expanded transit center, one like the underground bus transit center in downtown Boise Idaho (seriously, Boise has a nicer transit facility in their downtown than anything DART has)",

Cypress waters station isn't freeway aligned though, and there are some jobs nearby (not in the walkshed) in a mixed use development. Still, definitely not ideal.

Uptown is probably one of the most urban neighborhoods in all of Texas. Yet DART barely provides any useful service. MATA does all of the heavy lifting. Yes there is a light rail stop, but it is on the edge of Uptown (and honestly not very useful, but that is the light rail system in a nutshell).\n\nMATA gives direct access to a ton of useful destinations such as Klyde Warren, dining, groceries, and more.

Just like we didn't make the transit mall underground in 1990s so we must spend more than 2 billion to revise that if now.\n\nBut I know Dart is hard to allocate funds on that without federal or state support. And they probably won't choose the plan they've discussed earlier due to the rebuild of I-30 and Conv Center, which may provide chance for generating a better plan.",

How about a streetcar from downtown to Mockingbird Station via Ross and Greenville? This would be a fraction of the price of the silver line and would serve many, many more people.\n\nBut Addison wants a picture of a train on their website. So we get this boondoggle instead.",

I mostly think this was to keep the riffraff on the south side, but it was a popular idea among operators. \n\nI'd still like to see some kind of downtown bypass or alternate route construction, but if this means we get new trains sooner, I'm all about it.",

However, because of the I-345 plans TxDot made surfacing in deep ellum was no longer an option. Also, land owners in deep ellum were super opposed to it, as was the deep ellum foundation.\n\nThe new operating pattern, which routes Buckner to UNT, was chosen afterwards because there was a new design for D2. The specific routing was chosen because it minimized transfers for low income passengers.\n\nThere was a way to solve that connectivity issue you bring up on south Dallas, and it was discussed here, on item 11.\n\nhttps://dart.new.swagit.com/videos/10272021-588\n\n\n\nThe solution, if you don't care to watch a board meeting (and fair enough lol) is to add a purple line from bachman to Buckner during rush hour. I thought this was really lame,extend it to run all day and go to Frankfort to Buckner all day. However, I think this kind of planning just shows how financially constrained DART was. \n\nOther D2 service patterns plans just showed them running  red lines train during rush hour.\n\n\nThe reliability benefit is real, as you said one incident on the transit mall causes delays on all lines. But I was talking to a board member and the whole reason they were gonna do D2 was because of rush hour Parker road to West end red line/orange line overcrowding. That's no longer a concern with work from home easing rush hour demand, and our new extended platforms.",

Mockingbird, Union Station, etc.) so when there's track construction they have to resort to using a blank sign which is extremely stupid. \n\nI also agree with changing the LED signs a bit. UNT sign should be turned into UNT Dallas, LBJ/Central should be on one frame, not two, MLK should be MLK Jr., etc. \n\nReplacing the destination boards at stations would be expensive but upgrading the LEDs is just adding a few more lines of code and distributing a software update to all SLRVs.",

And that's not to say we won't get BRT, but I think these small optimizations are important too. And DART is considering bus lanes too.

Glad to see them operating 7 days, 6:00-22:00. And with their own route numbers.",

        "selftext": "This is an important post and I really hope it gets the attention of staff. \n\nEcho is a contractor responsible for running DART's shuttle routes. A few days ago, you may recall a post on this subreddit of someone expressing frustration that their galatyn park shuttle never arrived (https://www.reddit.com/r/dart/comments/14ebemy/is_the_408_galatyn_shuttle_even_operating/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n\nI wish there was something I can link, but urbanist advocate and DART Citizens Actions Committee member Hexel Colorado has complained that the SMU shuttle route did not even remotely follow the schedule or frequencies.\n\nThen, there's me, and my own experience. I use a shuttle route to get to work, I won't disclose which one because that would give away my employer. The past two days, my bus route went off route. There's a new rule my bus driver has to follow, and that's if a passenger wants to go somewhere off the route, the passenger gets taken there. Even if that means the bus has to skip stops.\n\nThat's right, because a passenger asked my bus driver to go to a different building, my bus driver was forced to skip several stops people are waiting at and expecting a bus to arrive.\n\n\nThis ruins the shuttle routes for me. They are completely unusable now, might as well not exist. A bus may never arrive. I confronted my bus driver about this, he said he is against it. He doesn't want to deviate from the route, he feels it's just not right. However, he's being told to do it.\n\n\nSo what's the deal with shuttle route? Well, DART does not operate them. They hire a contractor, Echo transportation, to run these routes.\n\nEcho transportation is a garbage company if this is what their idea of a fixed route service is. They need to correct this immediately, and if they don't DART needs to terminate their contract with them and find a new provider. This is not at all acceptable, and DART needs to take a closer look at their contractors because I highly doubt this is what they want.\n\nIf anyone wants to follow up about this, message me on Reddit we can get in touch. I want to disclose the route, but that would disclose my employer because shuttle routes exist to serve one or a few specific locations.",

There used to be a cop on every train, it didn't last long because having a cop on every train didn't give them the flexibility to respond to emergencies as well. For example, if there was a situation on a bus or somewhere else, the cops couldn't easily get in a car and go. \n\nThe board however, always notes that they still liked that policy of a cop on every train and they claim it did make a difference.\n\nWe may go back to something close to that, or perhaps a compromise or something... But it would probably take a few years before they could and that's what the security contract is there for. To buy them time to hire more police is how I understood it.",

The main thing I is there are Denver Transit Police on every train, and they seemed to be hanging out at bus transfer centers.

Now ride that same route and count how many DART cops you see sitting in their cars at train stations. You would run out of fingers toes and any other body parts you can think of. It\u2019s really all they do, drive from station to station and sit in their cars. On the rare occasion that they get out of their cars they are joined by 3 or 4 other DART police. If they get on a train, they stand in a group talking to each other and looking at their phones. On very rare occasions they will check the tickets of people that walk by their group but mostly just talking crap with the other cops. At the next stop they get off in a group and move to another car to again not check tickets.\n\nThey do not have a lack of officer\u2019s issue, they have a lack of leadership/motivation issue. If they actually put the transit police on the transit system then most of the crime issues would go away. \n\nThe added security is to keep the DART police and their union happy; it will also be the basis of a future fare increase of several times its actual cost.\n\nPut DART cops on DART, sound pretty simple to me.",

        "selftext": "I reference tier 1 and tier 2 a LOT, but, I need a convenient reference post with all this information that I can use as a source or send to people. I want everyone to know what tier one and tier two is, because its going to completely change how we use the system and its going to address a lot of the problems with DART we have today.\n\nA lot of you will already know all of this information, there is nothing new for you. But for everyone else, there's a lot of exciting changes coming to DART. Here's the breakdown.\n\nDART is planning on investing more resources into bus and train service. They want to do this in two tiers. Tier 1 represents a more near term improvement, and tier 2 represents a more long term improvement.\n\n# Tier one Information:\n\nTier 1 does some frequency promotions. This is just taking the best performing routes and improving their frequency so they run more often.\n\nFirst, the format i will be using to describe schedules: xx/yy/zz where xx is the rush hour schedule, yy is the off peak schedule (midday, evening after rush hour) and zz is the very late at night or very early morning schedule.  \n\n\nFor example, the route 16's headways are 15/20/30, route 16 runs 15 minute peak service, 20 minute inbetween rush hours, 20 minutes after the evening rush hour, and finally, late at night after 10 pm, the route 16 goes down to 30 minute headways.  \n\n\nHere are the bus routes planned for a frequency improvement as apart of tier 1:\n\nRoute 13 (South Dallas, Fair Park, and Downtown) 15/20/30 -> 15/15/30\n\nRoute 101 (Medical district, Hampton station, red bird transit center) 15/30/30 -> 15/15/30\n\nRoute 104 (MLK jr, westmoreland station, Dallas mountain view college) -> 15/30/30 -> 15/20/30\n\nRoute 108 (Camp wisdom to westmorland station) 15/30/30 -> 15/15/30\n\nRoute 218 (Lawnview to Lake june, serves Pleasant Grove) 30/40/60 -> 15/20/30\n\nRoute 239 (serves DNT, legacy west plano, Addison, downtown Dallas) 30/40/60 -> 15/20/30\n\nRoute 241 (NW Plano Park and ride, coit, forest lane station) 30/40/60 -> 15/20/30\n\n883 east (UTD, Cityline, Renner) 30/30/30 -> 15 minutes or better (dont know the headways here)\n\nRoute 229 (downtown Irving, north lake college, downtown carrolton, Addison) 30/40/60 -> 15/20/30\n\nRoute 230 (Airport area, Downtown Irving, Medical District, Downtown Dallas) 30/40/60 -> 15/20/30\n\nRoute 22, between forest lane and forest Jupiter station only, will go from 15/20/30 -> 15/15/30 or better (i dont know the exact numbers for this one)\n\nRoute 200 (downtown garland, spring valley station) ->30/40/60 -> 15/20/30\n\n[Click here for a tier one map](https://imgur.com/iUwn2vT)\n\n# Tier Two information:\n\nSo, all those frequency improvements mentioned as apart of tier one, will apply to tier two. On top of that, tier two will extend the rush hour schedule to last from 6 am to 10 pm on almost all routes, even on weekends. The rush hour headways will just be your all day headways. This means most routes will run on 15 minute headways or 30 minute headways all day.\n\nWhat's more, the light rail will run on 15 minute headways from 6 am to 10 pm\n\n[Click here for a map of tier two](https://imgur.com/05pwdZ5)\n\n  \nWith tier two, you will almost never be waiting more than 30 minutes on an absolute worst case scenario  \n[And here is a base DART, current (as of June 12th 2023) map for comparison](https://imgur.com/a/st5kin2)  \n\n\nYou may have to click on the image to zoom in and see a clearer view, but these maps are clear and not blurry.  \n\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask. This will be a reference post I use again and again, so I will be editing this post if I get a lot of questions about something thats not clear.",

These represent the first set of service changes that work towards the tier 1 and tier 2 service. We will not get all of tier 1 next year, but we will take steps to it.  \n\n\nIn August, or early Fall, service planning will bring these improvements to the board. Around this time, we will also get an updated version of tier 1 and tier 2. It really sounded like the updated versions of tier 1 and tier 2 would be better than what we saw before. Changes to routes, adjustments to frequency assumptions, and an extra bump up in service levels from the original tier 1 and tier 2.  \n\n\nDART is also doing some costing on a tier 3. What does tier 3 even entail? No idea, we will hear more about it later.  \n\n\nNow, I'm gonna go into speculation territory on what tier 3 is and when we might see it. Nothing here   \n\n\nTier 1 improves the frequency of a few key bus routes. Tier 2 takes those improvements, and makes the rush hour schedule the all day schedule. My prediction is that tier 3 enhances the network by adding new bus routes and new connections.  Maybe you have a neighborhood that has a north/south bus route, but not an east west. Its possible that tier 3 will add east west connectivity to this example neighborhood. Perhaps tier 3 will add new express bus routes, to make it easier to travel long distances.   \n\n\nAnother possibility, is tier 3 could get us to 10 minute service on frequent routes and light rail. [As mentioned here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dart/comments/11z8hl0/dart_can_do_10_minute_rail_service_without_d2/), DART does not need D2 to achieve 10 minute service, however, they cannot achieve 10 minute service on the light rail today without some infrastructure upgrades.   \n\n\nI will start another discussion about achieving tier 3, perhaps another day. It feels impossible, tier 2 still feels impossible to me. We dont know a thing about tier 3 and I'm sitting here amazed that it was even suggested and I'm already wondering if its really possible. I hope we get more details on tier 3 soon, and I want more concrete timelines on tier 1 and 2.",

Ridership is growing, and the recovery has not stopped yet, but they are still missing around 30% of the pre-pandemic riders. \n\nSo how could the pandemic be good for DART? Of the recovery continues, DART may actually reach pre-pandemic levels of ridership in around 2-3 years. The riders returning least are the rush hour 9-5 commuter, and currently, there is much less of a peak during the rush hour than there used to be. Demand is more spread out over the midday as well\n\nThis is good because, taking out an extra bus just to run it for 3 hours is expensive. Very very expensive. There is labor costs associated with bringing it to and from the yard, if you can use that bus all day you get more for your money. \n\nWhat the pandemic may let DART do is focus it's resources on providing good service all day instead of having to dedicate so many resources to handle the rush hour peak. One thing to also note, Sundays are already back to pre-pandemic ridership levels. This means that non-remote workers are returning to transit and transit usage may actually be growing this demographic. That demographic may not always be traveling during the rush hour, their shifts start and end at all times of day. Serving these trips is what will make DART better\n\n\nEDIT: Apparently, you always do a full days work even if you drive an extra bus taken out for peak for DART\n\nAlthough, you still get more revenue hours for your buck if you were to extend the rush hour peak schedule to last all day, that much I know is true",

Dallas has (and still has) the best plan to make use of that money and now those will have to be scaled back\n\nIt seems like DART was successful here, I really tried to get more details on this but both Dallas and DART were not really willing to divulge details. Their meetings went into closed sessions when discussing this and if I had to guess that's probably because of legal reasons, and DART and Dallas not wanting to show each other their hand in case this went to court (but I don't know the real reason so don't quote me on that)\n\nSo because it was a he said /she said type situation, we never really got the full picture. DART accused Dallas of not giving them permits, Dallas said it's because DART wasn't complying with their betterment agreements, DART disagreed.  Most of you on this sub (myself included) and most people on r/Dallas assumed Dallas was at fault, and that's definitely how it seemed but we didn't know for certain... Until now, because Dallas here is agreeing to lose out on all that money\n\n\nDallas would have lost out on even more, but the council of governments stepped in and contributed $16 million. That sounds like an acknowledgement that Dallas was in the wrong here.\n\n\nWell done to DART for protecting transit dollars here. Dallas caused delays, which cost DART money. DART found a way to shift the burden inflicted by Dallas back to Dallas. \n\nI just wish Dallas didn't waste their time. They were gonna use this money to build new sidewalks, upgrade sidewalks and ramps to ADA compliance, and upgrade traffic signals on bus routes (I assume this means signal priority for buses but I can't tell. Either way it would probably speed up the buses)\n\nThankfully, Dallas still gets some money, though their plans will be scaled back.",

Not just any apartments though, these apartments have a certain characteristic that makes them a huge ridership generator. There is a very large transit dependent population that lives here, students. Students who don't have a car, who don't have any other way of getting around. Serving these populations is how you get good ridership. And guess what, transit ridership in this neighborhood is already some of the best in the whole DART system. This neighborhood is a true success story for DART.  \n\n\nWe can't just consider the surrounding land use though, because connections to other transit can also drive ridership at a station. Coit road, has the 883 west, which is the best performing bus route in the entire DART system. These apartments (and a few others not pictured here) are able to support a bus route that runs at 9 minute headways. The most frequent bus route DART operates runs right through this neighborhood. The route 241 also runs through the area, and would have been able to connect to this station. The 241 is another strong performer that gets lots of ridership, but since it doesn't connect to Addison, transferring to the 241 from the silver line was made impossible once DART removed the station  \n\n\nWhy did DART kill this station? Because the NIMBY home owners didnt want it. Dallas did not want a station here. But something tells me, nobody talked to the renters who lived here. It was wealthy homeowners who opposed it, not transit dependents. The money that would have been used to build the Coit road station is gone. It went to betterments instead. And guess what, they still aren't happy with their betterments. DART killed two train stations to appease the NIMBYs and put that money towards betterments, and they still aren't happy.  \n\n\nMost importantly though, riders should be at the forefront of every decision made by DART, and I can't help but think riders were not at all at the forefront of this decision at all. Rider experience is what matters most, and this didn't help with rider experience. This limits the options riders have and increases trip time, while simultaneously decreasing ridership.  \n\n\nThis was 100% avoidable. DART could have simply just axed Preston and kept Coit. I had no idea the silver line was being planned at the time, but advocates could have pushed DART to keep the stations. Comets For Better Transit exists today, and they would have tried to protect Coit station. We could have applied pressure too, but its too late for any of that.   \n\n\nSources:  \n[https://dart.new.swagit.com/play/231509/8](https://dart.new.swagit.com/play/231509/8) (old Board meeting about this)  \n[https://communityimpact.com/dallas-fort-worth/plano/top-stories/2018/08/28/transit-agency-board-of-directors-votes-to-remove-coit-preston-road-rail-stations-from-future-cotton-belt-line/](https://communityimpact.com/dallas-fort-worth/plano/top-stories/2018/08/28/transit-agency-board-of-directors-votes-to-remove-coit-preston-road-rail-stations-from-future-cotton-belt-line/) (old article)",

They won't flip a switch and create this network all at once, but they will work towards it \n   * I suspect we may see off peak improvements first, and a slow \"expansion\" of the rush hour schedule. While this is happening, I think DART will keep promoting overperforming bus routes to have higher service\n* On ***JULY 11th***, we will find out how much money DART wants to put towards service improvements because this is when they do their budgeting\n   * From there, they will be able to make a draft plan for the first round of improvements\n   * We will know how much money DART has to work with, and if we want we can look at the cost to run bus routes on the quarterly reports and speculate on how substantial the improvements will be\n* The first round of improvements will start ***NEXT YEAR***\n   * Again, we won't know the extent of these improvements until July\n* When will we know what the improvements will be? It sounds like July or August but my interpretation could be wrong (judge for yourself, 7 minutes, 40 seconds in the video)\n* What follows is long discussion about GoLink, its advantages and shortcomings, and its current success\n   * they were largely optimistic about the service, but do worry that it will become too expensive to operate if too many people use it\n   * If you wanna know the details, I recommend listening to this portion\n* Apparently, the tier one bus network DART presented to the public (which I talked about [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dart/comments/11sgtc8/tier_1_bus_network_more_of_a_near_term_improvement/)) also improves weekend frequency??? Which is huge information I never knew. The daytime schedule for bus and rail in the tier one proposal would be extended from 6 am to 10 pm on the bus and rail network. This means no more 30 minute waits for the train on saturday evenings \n   * for those curious, this was discussed 35-36 minutes in\n* Due to changes in travel demand, there is much less of a peak in ridership\n* The peak is now 2:30-3pm weekdays, not what it used to be\n* Because of that, I expect service improvements to focus on the off peak  \n\n\nI expect midday, off peak, and weekend service to reach or surpass prepandemic ridership. its rush hour that may not recover. Well, the good news is DART was kind of at capacity prepandemic rush hour, so if their ridership is spread out throughout the day that may actually be a good thing, instead of handling a ton of riders all at once. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR;  \n\n\n\\-More golink zone to zone  \n\\-Phased improvements planned, first set of improvements confirmed for next year  \n\\-ridership more spread out throughout the day now   \n\\-In July 11th, its budget season and this summer we will get a clearer idea on what's to come.",

Besides that, it leaves open the ability to run BRT lanes / rail / bikes down the boulevard in the future and do the work of reconnecting the fabric of these neighborhoods.\n\nThe hybrid really seems like the worst option since it costs $1 billion and includes zero capping of the highway.  Walking under an elevated highway isn't pleasant but it's better than walking on a stroad-style bridge over a trenched highway since the traffic noises are all funneled directly up.\n\nWhat a disappointing decision, the only real highlight is the ability to cap parts of the trench in the future but that still leaves the ramps at Cesar Chavez and other interchanges in the way.",

They are dependent on those fares, not to the same extent as some other transit systems, but they are still important.\n\nAlso, if you want to transfer to bus you might as well pay the fare for the train because the same ticket/pass works on both.\n\nNow, I understand your complaint about VIA, and that situation is unfortunate. Your transit pass in an ideal would also cover your VIA costs and I wish it did. It doesn't due to political reasons, the city of Arlington has not joined a transit agency. They don't pay taxes into the DART transit system, if they did your on demand ride to the train station would be covered by your train fare. Arlington chose to spend their sales tax in other ways (like stadiums)\n\nThe via plus DART cost does seem hard to cover. If you have the chance, you should talk to your city council members about this issue, talk about them maybe working with DART to unify the VIA and DART fare, provide some sort of discount, or maybe even talk to them about having Arlington join DART.\n\nIn the meantime, there aren't just transit discounts for seniors and students.

And it's gonna connect to the silver line too, things are looking up for the service. But TexRail has gotta run more frequency and more feeder bus routes in the suburbs.

For weekday, I expect it to take longer however weekday and offpeak ridership on weekday may return or even surpass prepandemic levels. The rush hour is what won't recover for a while.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[GoLink ridership ](https://preview.redd.it/332kk22xd71b1.png?width=296&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d2b9cd82854a9f488bfe2fa04888b1dfd82baf5)\n\n  \nThis is GoLink ridership compared to dec 2022. The extended hours has resulted in massive ridership gains. Sunday ridership is way up because before January of this year, most GoLink zones didn't have Sunday service.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/psskan4de71b1.png?width=885&format=png&auto=webp&s=fafb45461289408e252ec3f975b842b7e7970b2e\n\n  \nBus ridership is up 16% from last year, and LRT is up 12.7%. GoLink once again seeing absurd gains, but since GoLink ridership is relatively small % of ridership the overall system still saw just 15.3% ridership gains, which is still great to see.  \n\n\n  \nIn this presentation, DART also went through feedback they got at these meetings they held in March. I went to one of these meetings, so I'm familiar with some of the feedback they received.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Feedback**:  \n\n\n* Extend all Orange Line trips to Parker Road \n* More service on UTD Shuttle \n* Move faster with planned frequency improvements (move faster with phase 2 of the bus network improvements)\n* Longer service hours\n* Improvements to suburban fixed-route service \n* More in-between routes, return of the \u201cbetween\u201d routes like 21 \n* Questions about ridership response to wider hours on GoLink and pandemic recovery generally  (I think a lot of those questions probably came from me lol)\n* Expand to more cities \n\nThere was more feedback given, but that was the feedback I found to be the most notable.   \n\n\nDART went into great detail in the Plano meeting about the politics that hold them back from expanding into more cities, and the death of transit expansion into any new municipalities across the whole state of Texas. I have this recorded, maybe I'll post it soon",

        "selftext": "In the month of October, 2022, GoLink saw 44,883 riders.\n\nFast forward to March, 2022, and GoLink saw 91,040 riders. That's almost double\n\nI suspect there are two main reasons for this. People getting used to the relatively new service, and GoLink extended hours. As of January, GoLink in all zones runs till midnight and on weekends. DART did increase the GoLink budget to accommodate the service increase, but increasing service at night and on weekends increased demand during weekdays and daytime hours too.\n\n\nMy main point is, GoLink is doing just great right now, the ridership is really growing.\n\nWhat is my main concern then? The way GoLink works, DART has GoLink drivers that will come and pick you up. But if there aren't any available they just pay for an Uber for you. That's fine and all, but that means every additional trip costs extra money, because that's an extra Uber ride DART would otherwise not pay for.\n\nIf a fixed route bus gets a new rider, that's no problem. One less seat is occupied, but that did not cost DART any money, if anything it's just more fare revenue and lower subsidy per passenger. Bus route ridership has been increasing too, but for DART that just means more occupied seats. \n\nEventually yes the bus will get too full, and DART has to increase frequency and that does cost money. We have seen this happen before and we see it happening now. \n\nHowever, it's much easier and cheaper to expand bus capacity, and once you do expand bus capacity by say, running an extra bus per hour, you've still added capacity for probably around 40 customers per hour (I have no idea how how much passenger capacity those buses have)\n\nIf a golink zone wanted to carry an additional 40 customers per hour, that's an additional 40 Uber trips. Or, if we used dedicated GoLink drivers only and assume they can carry 3 passengers per hour, you would have to hire an additional 14 GoLink drivers. That's way more expensive than running an extra bus, or even 2-3 extra buses\n\n\nGoLink ridership is growing rapidly. This could quickly balloon into a very expensive cost for DART. The solutions to this would have to either reduce demand (by making the service worse or increase prices), or to keep putting more money into the service.\n\n\nInfact, it's already costing DART money. They had to increase their Uber contract by $5 million a few days ago, if they didn't increase their contract they would have run out of money by fall. The contract was supposed to be enough to last the full year. \n\n\nYou could of course, replace GoLink zones with fixed route services. But I also wonder, if a community got used to an on demand type transit service, how willing would they be to switch over to fixed route? \n\nIf DART did replace a GoLink zone with a bus route, would that route be reachable by all the same customers that used the GoLink zone?\n\n\nI don't have the answers, but the fact that DART already had to increase their Uber contract exposes the flaw with the on demand transit system they leaned so heavily into with the bus network redesign. \n\n\nThis is all uncharted territory too, so it's hard to predict how things will turn out.",

Switching to fixed route would likely look like a 30/40/60-minute bus about a 4 minute walk from my house. Right now I can get to my station with an on-demand ride, but that switch would mean I would have to wait up to an hour to catch a bus that might not even go anywhere near where I need it.\n\nFunding aside, GoLink is perfect for areas like Plano that would never see enough ridership to justify a route.",

These people all have cars, and if they don't, they probably shouldn't live in a single family home. Sorry.

They all have some good ridership opportunities and they have jobs people in Dallas need access to. They should be provided with something, it's all about the ridership coverage tradeoff.\n\nIf a golink zone is at capacity, single family or not, that's an indication to me a fixed route bus service may be successful.  Some of DART's best performers run through predominantly single family areas, because when it comes to the DART service area urban form and density is not the best indicator of how well a bus service will perform. It's income, or I should say, a lack of income. That's your big ridership predictor. Like it or not a lot of single family neighborhoods are low income and have a lot of residents who can't afford a car. A lot of these homes are older, and smaller than them mansions you imagine in Frisco. Garland, Irving, and Richardson have lots of transit dependents. Plano has some, but more importantly in Plano's case Plano has a lot of opportunities I think people deserve access too.\n\nDART has some excellent performers in the suburbs right now, and I think writing off their ridership potential and their need for transit service is a mistake. \n\n\nHere's what I think will happen: some GoLink zones may eventually need to be replaced in part or in full by fixed route service, but many others will not reach capacity constraints.

AND, BART still has a massive problem with fare evasion and need to have a team of fare enforcement agents.\n\nimo, just hire more fare enforcement agents and pair them with police officers that can arrest evaders on the spot if they refuse to identify or cooperate when unable to provide proof of payment. cheaper for the taxpayer and a better rider experience for everyone.",

This was very handy for my job but it really sucked when it was my day off or I stayed up late. Its been 17yrs since I worked at starbucks and I still wake up at 430 every day, no matter the time I went to sleep. So I have to make myself go to bed by 930-10 or the next day will suck. Actually 830-9 is my best bedtime but I have teenagers in the house and that will not work.",

I was so tired I had to sleep in. \n\nFor me though sleep just got a lot better when I started exercising once a week. I've always done a lot of walking but never anything intense, but intense exercise more or less solved my sleep issues for me.\n\nThe days I described in my post were exceptions, not the rule. Exercise probably worked so well for me because I went from having no intense exercise to an okay amount, it easily tired out my body. I'd imagine it may be more difficult for someone who is already fit but I really don't know.",

The owner told me stories about how DART was supposed to be a subway system more focused on the urban core of Dallas instead of the suburbs but after major obstacles with budget and more emphasis on the surrounding suburbs it was decided to be turned into a light rail system scrapping most of the urban core routes and replacing it with buses. That\u2019s why DART decided to get rid of all the concept subway cars with the owner\u2019s friend keeping one of them. I have also heard in the past that DART had wildly different plans from the current network focusing more on the urban core and that even an underground tunnel got built along with City Hall in order to be used for the future expansion of the system. If anyone can provide me with any information about the early plans for DART I would be really grateful",

They could just change nothing, keep doing what they are doing, probably recover a good amount of riders.\n\n2. Silver line service will bring more riders\n\n3. GoLink expansion will bring more riders \n\n4. Eventually, I'm sure DART will create new bus routes. That will improve ridership\n\n5. Downtown Dallas is replacing empty office space with residential, creating a healthier more active downtown. Given that most of DART's routes go through downtown, any extra activity in that area has a disproportionately large impact on ridership. The booming residential population will also bring more jobs as retail and restaurants will want to serve the new residents.\n\n6. Suburbs TOD should also still have an impact \n\n7. Bus corridor improvement plan should have an impact, speeding up buses and increasing reliability should lead to, at minimum, modest ridership gains\n\n8.

The single seat shelter looks like a great option for less busy stops that DART is currently resistant to provide shelter to. \n\nThe stop on the 105 by me has no bench or anything, and I often see people sitting on the ground while they wait. Lack of any shelter or furniture certainly harms the rider experience, and only reenforces negative stigmas about public transit for passers-by. Even if these new shelters are primarily used to replace existing furniture, hopefully the excess current benches and shelters can be distributed to stops with nothing at the moment.",

If they hit a time point early, they wait. There's a science behind placing time points, and there's an optimal ratio of time point to non time point stops. I think you'll run into this soon, the bus makes an announcement \"we are early and will leave shortly\" something along those lines.\n\nArriving early is one of the only causes for delay that the bus driver can actually control, so it's something they can improve without bus lanes.",

        "selftext": "Earlier, I talked about  Senate Bill 1370 and House Bill 3146\n\nThese bills would require DART to provide member cities information on how much money DART is spending in their city. That's the simplest way to explain it. It is intended to be a transparency bill.\n\nWhen I talked about this legislation, I said would require DART to spend money proportional to member city contribution. That was my understanding of the legislation, no media had covered it yet so I had to look at the bill itself. And I misunderstood the bill in a very serious way, completely butchering the intent behind the legislation. To be fair to myself, I am not a lawyer or a policy maker, and I'm not experienced in parsing information in legislation. However, I have to set the record straight, especially now that this bill is starting to get some media attention.\n\nDoes the bill still have problems? Yes, the methodology concerns I brought up in the past still apply. If this bill were to pass, DART needs to find some sort of methodology for calculating how much they spend in a member city. For example, the routes 239 and 308 that connect Plano to downtown dallas. These routes pick up passengers in Plano, drives down the toll road through dallas, then drop off passengers in uptown and downtown (then it takes passengers back home in the evening)\n\nTechnically, DART is spending money in Dallas to operate these routes, most of the time these routes are in Dallas (especially the 308) they aren't picking up passengers. So who gets that cost allocation, Dallas, Plano, 50/50 split between the two? Very complicated question to answer.\n\nSome board members also argue this whole process would pit the 13 member cities against each other as they fight for DART spending and try to use whichever methodology makes their city look like they get the least value out of DART. All 13 member cities would need to agree on a methodology, and that is not going to be an easy task.\n\nYou could also argue the end result would be, DART having to spend money proportionally among its municipalities. However, I was wrong in saying the bill would force DART to do that. All it does is require DART to report how much they spend in each city.",

I pull up GoPass and lo and behold the next bus doesn't come for another 55 minutes (I just missed the last one, route 209). \n\nHow does DART expect anyone to use the bus system when you potentially have to wait an hour for the next bus? I know that area has historically been against transit, specifically the never finished light rail station. Still, 60 minute headways for a busy, pedestrian oriented area is terrible. \n\nI ended up crossing over 75 and getting on another bus that took me to Mockingbird Station. Even then, that bus didn't arrive until I had almost reached Mockingbird (I didn't want to wait around at a bus stop that didn't even have a bench). \n\n*Rant over*\n\nAlso, why does Dallas not have a bike share?

        "selftext": "If you want the TLDR; we here at r/DART (the moderators, and members of the subreddit who live in Plano that I talked to) are in unanimous agreement that Brett Cooper (Place 5) and Rick Horne (Place 3) are the best candidates for transit in Plano, and the ones most in line with our views for a better DART.\n\nIf you live in Plano, you can vote for both (if you want) of these candidates in May. Go VOTE! Early voting starts soon. \n\nThese elections are done at large, so no matter which district you live in, you can participate in BOTH of these races. Other races are uncontested or not happening right now.\n\n\n\nNow, for my justification.\n\nRick Horne, Place 3:\n\n\nRick Horne is of course, supportive of public transportation. He is also in favor of bike lanes, which complements public transportation very well. He criticizes Plano for having grey deserts of empty parking lots, which is a breath of fresh air compared to his opponent, Colleen Aguilar-Epstien, who complains about empty buses that are not actually empty. \n\nRick Horne suggests we transform these failing retail centers into mixed use, walkable centers with residential and retail. Meanwhile his opponent, Colleen Aguilar-Epstien, is opposed to creating mixed use development like this, even though the mixed use would be replacing strip malls that do not serve transit users, walkers, bikers, or even drivers very well. Colleen is opposed to denser housing being built on land in Plano that is currently completely empty, and again population is important not just for DART but for all city services. Spreading the tax burden can keep your taxes low while also increasing the amount of funding DART has (more residents = more riders, and more buyers = more sales tax, which funds DART)\n\nWhen asked about transit improvements, the Colleen immediately starts talking about urban gondolas rather than improvements that we as riders what to see such as higher frequency buses and trains, GoLink improvements, or transit signal priority.\n\nI'm also skeptical about her rhetoric about wanting to \"re-negotiate our contract with DART and look for a more cost effective plan\", this sounds like, she may be in favor of budget cuts to DART but that's just my interpretation.\n\n\nRick Horne will help Plano transform itself into walkable,vibrant community that would increase Plano (and DART's) tax base and be easier to serve by transit. Colleen by contrast, wants to more or less keep the status quo and block mixed use, walkable neighborhoods from being built in these struggling retail centers. So much of DART's success depends on the member cities building and transforing communities to be more walkable, accessible, and easier to serve. That's why I prefer Rick Horne for Place 3\n\n\n\nBrett Cooper, Place 5:\n\nBrett Cooper has made getting around without a car a front and center issue in his campaign. He talks about it frequently on Facebook, but what really impressed me was when he went to the DART community meeting in Plano. He was telling DART to increase frequency to get more passengers, giving them genuinely good feedback about their services and issues with the system. He is talking to staff about suggestions that would really benefit DART riders in Plano, I was blown away. Brett Cooper uses DART to get to work, his first hand experience using the system gives him the upper hand over his opponent. Shelby Williams, his opponent criticized DART for running empty buses in Plano and Dallas, but some of those Plano routes are often full, and even the least used bus routes in Plano are still far from empty. Criticizing the buses in this way is scary, especially when you consider many people have to rely on those buses. Williams makes a good point, that waiting a long time for a bus is not a good experience. However, he falls short by proposing urban gondolas instead of a more basic, simple solution that is proven to increase ridership: increasing frequency and reliability on the buses. Brett Cooper, on the other hand, was laser focused on improving reliability and frequency at the DART meeting which is what I think most of us really want at the end of the day.\n\nHousing policy is key to DART's success too, and Brett Cooper wants to keeping housing growth in Plano to help with the cities affordability. This increases DART's tax base. If Plano won't accommodate this growth, the growth may go to Frisco and Allen instead who do not have DART at all. That's bad for us as riders. Williams will tell you he is in favor of more housing too, such as over in the Collin creek mall area. However, Brett Cooper takes a stronger stance on the issue, and really emphasized the need to increase supply and the number of affordable units. In contrast, Shelby Williams talks about how he changed Plano's comprehensive plan to accommodate less housing. This hurts DART and housing affordability\n\n\nBrett Cooper gets bonus points for showing up to the Plano DART meetings, I didn't see anyone from Plano city council there or any other candidates. Huge props for attending.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore information:\n\nComet's for better transit candidate questionaire (includes candidates from Richardson and Plano):\n https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ndRxLe5vmQdF0okK-YO6hK1N8UzG319rJoKFwEsIkyg/edit?usp=drivesdk",

Has read the strong town book and is supportive of the Strong Towns message. she is anti-drive through (for good reasons), supportive of transit and safer streets. Focused on issues that matter, complained about state representatives going to Richardson city council to spew anti-trans rhetoric for 30 minutes. \n\n\nPaul Ridley, Dallas, district 14 (up for re-election) \n\nWants more housing, wants more housing near transit, is super supportive of transit, and supports the boulevard option for I-345\n\n\nBrett Cooper, Plano, Place 5 (candidate up for election, facing off against a candidate our governor endorsed, Shelby Williams)\n\nIs very focused on non-car travel, rides DART to work himself, created a meeting summary of the DART community meeting. I may be wrong, but he is the only council member or council candidate to have posted or say anything publicly about DART's tier two bus network. He talked to DART staff, advocated for more frequency on the light rail saying that frequency will increase ridership. \n\n\n\nChad West, Dallas, District 1(up for re-election)\n\nAsked Twitter user to email him photos of a rendering of traffic calmed Jefferson boulevard with dedicated bus and bike lanes, loves mixed use and walkability, supportive of transit, wants to build more housing, anti parking minimums. He is phenomenal on transportation issues, checks almost every box I would have. \n\n\nIf we had more council members like the ones I mentioned (and we have several across many different member cities) DART would be able to serve us a lot more effectively, and getting around without a car would be a lot easier.",

I have had some great conversations with my city council members about transit, the need for more housing, and mixed use developments. I know that no matter who wins the upcoming elections, I know that people who are generally supportive of transit will be in charge and that lets me rest easy.  \n\n\nPlano, in contrast, is a lot more divided on the issue of public transportation. We have candidates who want DART to stop running buses, candidates who think DART doesn't provide value to Plano. Plano has some very busy bus lines, bus stops, and GoLink Zones but many candidates for this upcoming election don't seem to know or care about this, and accuse DART of running empty buses and wasting their money (they don't by the way. DART cut their \"empty\" bus routes long ago in favor of golink service for those areas). Plano seems to be a lot more divided on higher density development as well, which is a huge help to DART as it increases tax base and creates an environment where bus and train service can actually succeed.  \n\n\nPlace 3 and Place 5 are up for re-election.\n\nMake sure you are voting in your local elections this May.",

        "selftext": "(DISCLAIMER: No one from the Plano City Council or the media should take this post personally. I like to rant; it's fun for me, so I don't actually mean for this post to be harsh. Please do take these criticisms into consideration, but I'm not trying to put all the blame on you.)\n\nYou have probably come across an article about a gondola system being planned in Plano. Plano has moved forward with an application to Swyft Cities to build an aerial Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) system in the Legacy West area.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Swyft Cities Rendering](https://preview.redd.it/0x5j35gs0sra1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=f531ff75b4ea4251575a1e56ba9bd707462f59ab)\n\nTo Plano's credit, Swyft Cities will be paying for the cost. The system is supposed to be profitable and is being sold as a solution to traffic that won't cost the taxpayer a dime. If I were Plano, I'd probably fill out the application too, maybe not expecting too much to come out of it. It's a low-risk, high-reward move, but I also wouldn't expect much to come out of the application. I'm not criticizing their decision here; it doesn't seem like Plano can really lose here (to my knowledge, anyways).\n\nThat doesn't change the fact that this gondola system is unproven; Swyft Cities isn't operating this system in any cities yet.  [On their website](https://swyftcities.com/), you'll see plenty of mockups and animations, but no concrete evidence of a working transit system. They have a small prototype system running in a garage with pods that can only carry one passenger, much smaller than the pods shown here that can carry four . I am skeptical, to say the least, after all this wouldn't be the first time people have been won over by a [futuristic animated mockup that hasn't actually proven itself yet.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadgetbahn)\n\nPlano City Council has fallen for the hype. At the Plano town hall at UT Dallas, council members were thrilled about these high-tech gondolas as a public transportation solution. To be fair, they did discuss the Silver Line too, but much of the discussion was focused on tech bro solutions that don't yet exist, such as dynamic AI bus routes and Jpods/Swyft Cities gondolas.\n\nThe media has been talking about it too, a quick google search yielded a handful of articles, including one from [WFAA](https://www.wfaa.com/article/tech/high-tech-gondolas-coming-north-texas-city/287-6e7c6713-ed29-4b55-b02a-6e0c5f4fa3bc), saying \"Anyone wanting more public transportation options around DFW may have something to look forward to as cities will soon begin discussing the possible implementation of Google-developed high-tech gondolas in congested areas around the metroplex.\"This is the public transportation news WFAA chose to cover. Let's keep that in mind; it will be important later.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is all this hype building for the gondola system in legacy west Plano, but the media we rely on to get our news seems to have completely neglected a far more impactful, meaningful change to our transportation network that's actually going to benefit millions of people and make getting around without a car way easier. [Is there maybe something much more exciting and tangible going on that many city council members and the media are completely oblivious to?](https://www.reddit.com/r/dart/comments/11tc9ak/long_term_vs_short_term_vs_current_transit_system/)\n\nThat's right, the solution to our public transportation woes is not fancy gondolas, its as simple as ***RUNNING MORE BUSES AND TRAINS***, which is where DART's tier two bus network comes in. 15-30 minute 6am to 10 pm service on nearly every route. 15 minute light rail service. Lots of routes getting huge promotions in frequency, and plans to add bus lanes, transit signal priority, queue jumps, and BRT style improvements to many routes. Just two days before that meeting at UTD where council members were discussing untested high tech solutions to transit, I was in Downtown Plano where DART was presenting real solutions to mobility that have a proven track record of working and getting people out of there cars.\n\nThere has also been no media coverage about tier two at all. If there is, I haven't seen it (if you have, prove me wrong and send it to me). I find that shocking how this huge transit agency that we spend hundreds of millions of dollars on is actually doing something really good and no one cares to talk about it. If you don't work for DART, didn't see my reddit post, didn't attend the public meetings, or didn't see my other social media posts, then you probably haven't even heard of their bus corridor improvement plans or their tier two bus network plans. And I don't blame you for that. To me its troubling that this transit subreddit become the only reliable way to get news about public transportation in a major city such as Dallas. I am not at all a journalist, why has this become my responsibility? My writing is shit\n\nAnd the media chooses to write about Swyft cities instead of these major transformational improvements? Don't get me wrong, swyft cities is worth covering, but is DART massively improving off peak frequencies not the bigger story here?\n\nOh and don't expect these gondolas to operate on a windy day. The transportation project we are so excited about isn't even going to work on a windy day (DART is winterizing its light rail btw)\n\n[Source: https:\\/\\/www.nctcog.org\\/getattachment\\/8bb1bb84-9938-4ebd-9f87-91228d6ea83d\\/CERTT\\_Round2\\_Swyft\\_QA.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/s6njghq84sra1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=879e3a3bda09899ca12fd3d0792e6dfaa54f5eda)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLook, I don't want Swyft cities to fail. If swyft cities can succeed, everyone wins, including transit riders. The west plano area is hard to serve by transit due to its form, and if swyft cities works as a last mile connection from transit then everyone can win. That doesn't mean I can't be disappointed that swyft cities can garner all of this attention using fancy renderings while DART is proposing actual solutions to traffic and mobility that no one is talking about.\n\nThe cherry on top is that Swyft cities themselves is going to depend on DART, and these bus networks improvement, to succeed (assuming they can succeed) so if you're excited for the gondolas, you should be excited about the bus network improvements too.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/atk3xhy65sra1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=38edefa261f9fa294676dd2a1cbb92c0720a1c2d\n\nAs you can see from this map, their network is going to get its ridership form people using that DART bus terminal. Despite the skepticism some members of Plano city council have on DART buses, this swyft cities proposal they love so much is only going to be able to work because of its connection to DART buses. All swyft cities is going to do is help you travel some short distance trips and maybe bridge that last mile gap between your bus stop and your destination. And you know what, if it succeeds, then great. Lets not pretend this is the solution to our car dependency though. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe DART needs to do better outreach here too, perhaps not all the blame should go to the media for neglecting their bus network plans. However, l put most of the responsibility on the media because if I can find out about tier two of the bus network SURELY our local news outlets can too. Reddit shouldn't be where most people go to learn about something this transformational. What DART showed off at the public meetings was big news, its time our local media starts treating it that way.",

New bus routes and other improvements to the transit network are *infrastructure*, and infrastructure isn't \"sexy\" to most people. Most people don't think in terms of the systems society is built on; they think in terms of improving their immediate place in life within the framework that is most familiar and comfortable to them, which in America is cars and private business. Gondolas are just cars in the sky with no pre-existing connotations other than maybe getting rich white people up a ski slope.\n\nI know that DART does marketing, but I want to see DART propaganda plastered everywhere. I want to see them have tables set up in high foot traffic areas where non-riders who are likely to be well-served by DART are passing by. Hell, I'd volunteer to help run a booth like that. They should be on college campuses and other places where younger folks hang out. But then they'd have to explain why, as a public service, they spend so much money on marketing, and I'm not sure how that will go over in Dallas.  But clearly, the system is only marketing itself to transit nerds and enthusiasts like us, so it needs more help.",

        "selftext": "Recently, I attended a Plano townhall at UT Dallas. Councilman Shelby Williams talked about, in great detail, how Plano was giving DART $100 million, and they only saw a fraction of that value returned by the services DART provided.\n\n  \nShelby Williams is maybe not the most transit friendly councilman in Plano. He accused DART of wasting money running empty buses no one wants to use, and suggests that even Dallas is getting a poor return on investment from DART.\n\nMatt Shaheen (represents West Plano in the state legislature) Ffiled a bill in the Texas state legislature that would require DART to provide service levels proportional to sales tax contribution by a member city. This would mean that, if you spend say, $80 million in sales tax to DART, DART would have to provide $80 Million worth of transit services.   \nI want to show you all a comparison between Garland and Plano's bus network:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/unc5bjxhz6ra1.png?width=536&format=png&auto=webp&s=db26bcdd1f0d2104658d8c40b51dba499def051d\n\n  \nAs you can see, Garland has a fairly comprehensive fixed route bus service, though the buses are not very frequent for the most part. Keep in mind, some of these routes are also serving Richardson and Dallas, not all of those bus miles are being driven in Garland.  \n\n\nLets take a look at Plano  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rpf2udytz6ra1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=99f7f240880ebe9cf11936cd437b81fbcdcce201\n\nI bring this up because I think this demonstrates where Plano is coming from. Sure, we don't know the costs of these services, but at a glance of the map you can maybe see how Plano might actually be getting less investment from DART than a city like Garland despite spending more money on DART services.  GoLink works well for Plano though, and GoLink requires a higher subsidy per passenger trip than fixed route service. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, here are those numbers I was talking about, what DART calculates they spend in each member city:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/batwgsl0z6ra1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=929a5b87df140132a3ca337512fefd947f1e2e27\n\nKeep in mind, DART has other revenue services besides sales tax. Fares, advertising, and federal grants. That's why they spend more in the service area cities than they receive from them.  \n\n\nAccording to these numbers, if accurate, Plano was actually getting more out of DART than their sales tax could provide in 2019.  \n\n\nWe also can't ignore the fact that DART is spending billions to bring the silver line to Plano, or that DART will probably give Plano some pretty serious frequency improvements in phase two of their network redesign.   \n\n\nSo, does DART need to fundamentally rethink their bus network and how they allocate resources so they can satisfy Plano? There's room for a lot of debate here, but if you ask me, I'd say no.  \n\n\nThere are gaps and opportunities in Plano that DART should work to address. DART replaced many buses in Plano with GoLink service, but a lot of the bus routes they replaced had very limited service, or sometimes rush hour only service. It may be worth exploring giving some of the axed fixed route corridors in Plano a proper shot, with full weekend and 6am to midnight service. Some Golink zones could be added and expanded as well. So don't get me wrong, I would NOT be opposed to more DART service in Plano.  \n \n\nHowever, I believe that imposing restrictions on where costs should be allocated within the DART network, based on each member city's contribution, would be counterproductive. While this may seem like a logical approach, it could hinder DART's ability to effectively allocate resources to meet the transit needs of all member cities and their residents. When making a transit network, ideally you may want to focus on travel patterns, serving commutes, ridership, and making a network useful to their riders in Plano and other member cities. You probably wouldn't focus disaggregating cost by member city contribution because that would be a hinderance to the network. Making DART better for Plano residents or commuters sometimes requires improving the DART network outside of Plano. \n\nHow many of you would benefit from a new route or increased frequency on a route outside of the city you live in? My guess is, almost all of you can think of a few improvements to the network that would make your life better that exist outside of the city you live in. Everyone who uses the route 239 in Plano can potentially benefit from every route that serves the Addison transit center, even if that route serves some other city such as Carrolton.  \n\n\nThe focus of DART staff shouldn't be \"well in this geographical boundary, we need to spend x amount more resources here\", it should be, \"for our 13 member cities and their residents, lets provide the most access possible and serve their commutes as best as we can\"",

Would running fixed routes there be more expensive? Or maybe did dart overcommit to goLink in Plano, removing a few fixed routes that should exist. Or is it just too expensive bc it's a new system for now. Or is it as simple as Plano big, and goLink is cheaper than a bus considering current ridership numbers in the goLink zones.",

Beyond that, the presentation doesn't disclose those details though I'm sure someone will ask about it during the meeting.  \n\n\nFantastic news all around, I know many of you will be excited about this one.

Before zoom we had a route that ran every 40ish minutes but today there's no fixed route service on campus. I was hoping someone here could point me in the right direction for researching how 883 works and how we'd go about getting a similar service here in Plano.",

Collin county college seems to be in a goLink zone now (kinda like Uber carpool, but a little slower, and muchhhh cheaper. Sometimes they just give a normal Uber for the price of go link) if they're short staffed, so you'd have to use that.\n\nAs far as getting a proper bus/shuttle, you'd have to contact dart directly. You could also contact them via your college or Plano. Extending 883 specifically might not be worth since it's kinda outta the way and there's a lot more paperwork since it's a joint operation between UTD and dart instead of just being a dart route, so you'd have to convince UTD AND DART. If it's just dart, all you have to do is prove that this could be a high ridership route, since that's what they need.\n\nEdit: by a lot cheaper I mean it's covered by a regular dart ticket. If you're buying a day pass at parker, your goLink won't cost any extra. It's not the same as a bus, but it's what's there\n\nEdit 2: If you can't convince dart that this would be a high ridership route, you could do what UTD student government did. UTD and DART have a deal where they both split the cost 50/50 since at the time dart wasn't convinced this route would be worth it (and utd wanted fares to be free). That's why the 883 works a little differently from the other dart routes.",

        "selftext": "Before I get started, If you haven't seen the map I made for the tier two and tier one bus network, I [highly recommend you take a look here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dart/comments/11tc9ak/long_term_vs_short_term_vs_current_transit_system/) I think the map I made is currently the highest quality image available of the tier one and tier two bus networks (DART PLEASE MAKE THIS AVAILABLE in high quality)\n\nThe main takeaway from this map is that DART is going to make some MASSIVE frequency improvements. A while ago, I made a post about the improvements DART is making and it really looks like we are starting to see some of those materialize.\n\nWith that out of the way, I asked staff a lot of questions, and here's all the info I've gathered:\n\nSERVICE IMPROVEMENTS:\n\n*  Orange line off peak to Parker road is something they have considered in the past. If enough people push for it they may do it \n   * [https://www.dart.org/futureprojects](https://www.dart.org/futureprojects) (survey here)\n*  883 east frequency boost likely coming fall semester  \n   * [This route gets overcrowded](https://www.reddit.com/r/dart/comments/xg6i65/route_883_east_desperately_needs_more_service/)\n* 883 west and east combined ridership has seen numbers as high as 8,000 riders per day\n* Later hours and weekend service GoLink has resulted in huge ridership gains \n   * Though keep in mind, GoLink is still low capacity. The two streetcar lines (mainly the m-line) see more ridership than all GoLink zones combined\n      * Although this may no longer be true with more weekend and late night service on the GoLink\n* There are two tiers of bus system improvements\n   * [Tier one](https://www.reddit.com/r/dart/comments/11sgtc8/tier_1_bus_network_more_of_a_near_term_improvement/), which increases frequency on select routes\n      * Cheaper to implement, will come within 5 years more likely than not\n      * Around 12 routes to see frequency improvements in tier one\n      * my tier one map is missing some super small and minor details (DART PLEASE MAKE THIS MAP AVAILABLE IN HIGH QUALITY)\n   * [Tier two](https://www.reddit.com/r/dart/comments/11sfi8j/this_changes_everything_tier_two_transit_network/), which increases frequency system wide and on select routes\n      * Tier two feels too good to be true\n      * The frequent routes now run 15 minutes from 6 am to 10 pm 7 days a week\n      * The local coverage routes now run 30 minutes all day 6 am to 10 pm 7 days a week\n      * Many routes in the suburbs, south dallas, oak cliff, and pleasant grove see promotions that go beyond the system wide improvements\n      * Way more expensive to implement, but DART is going to make it work as more money becomes available and as they [re-prioritize projects in their financial plan](https://www.facebook.com/groups/dartbusriders/posts/611868710356292/?comment_id=611975150345648)\n      * We can expect this to happen a little bit after 5 years, but its still up in the air. Staff seems very motivated to make tier two happen though\n* TRE Sunday service is something DART staff wants, but Trinity Metro is more hesitant on\n   * More details [regarding this here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dart/comments/124qcak/why_tre_sunday_service_hasnt_happened_yet/)\n* When DART increases or adds weekend service, ridership on the weekdays improves\n* When DART increases late night service, ridership during the day improves\n* When DART improves frequency, ridership improves on the route to fill in some of the new capacity enabled by the frequency\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNEW SERVICE:\n\n* Plano City Managers happy with GoLink Service, but they want more fixed route service\n* DART is primarily considering more east-west service in Plano\n   * Main route bring considered is a route that runs on spring creek from parker road station\n   * Have your own suggestions? [dart.org/futureprojects](https://dart.org/futureprojects)\n* This is apart of the area plans DART is making. For different sections of the service area, DART is making more focused plans and analysis for specific cities/neighborhoods to see what can be done to improve transit. \n* New golink zone near the air port in Irving\n   * But I suspect we will see GoLink zones expanded, and new ones come up to fill in the few remaining gaps in service DART has\n\nBUS INFRATSRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS:\n\n* Route 57 (westmoreland), sees ridership of over 3,500 per day, most popular route\n* The route 57 is the closest route to getting enough ridership to get federal funding for a bus rapid transit conversion\n* DART will do infrastructure upgrades on their highest ridership/frequency,  most unreliable bus routes to improve speed and reliability\n   * Potential upgrades includes [queue jumps](https://nacto.org/publication/transit-street-design-guide/intersections/intersection-design/queue-jump-lanes/), bus lanes, [signal priority](https://nacto.org/publication/transit-street-design-guide/intersections/signals-operations/active-transit-signal-priority/)\n* Bus reliability will still improve significantly without the infrastructure improvements. Some routes see on time performance below 70%, while others are higher than 90%, but the general average is around 83-85% (where On time performance is defined a bus coming between 1 minute early and no more than 5 minutes late)\n   * Tweaks and adjustments are being made to improve the worst performers\n   * 85% is not too bad considering the reality that buses have to share the road with traffic\n      * but with infrastructure upgrades it could do better\n* DART already has funding for bus corridor improvements in their financial plan\n* If you notice your bus getting delayed at a particular intersection or road, let them know by emailing [serviceplanning@dart.org](mailto:serviceplanning@dart.org) they want to know where your bus needs the most help to get moving. They want to know where their infrastructure improvements need to go\n* They want to do this on their most frequent routes. This includes routes slated to get frequency improvements in tier one and tier two\n\n&#x200B;\n\nD2 UPDATE:\n\n* DART does not need D2 to achieve 10 minute headways on the rail\n   * improvements to mocking bird, pearl, and west end junctions are needed though\n   * [More details here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dart/comments/11z8hl0/dart_can_do_10_minute_rail_service_without_d2/)\n* If we want to go Beyond 10 minute headways, we will probably need D2\n* While Tier Two focuses on achieving more 15 minute and 30 minute service, Nadine Lee's goal is to achieve 10 minute service on the frequent bus and light rail\n   * But this is really long term from what I can tell. I'm not expecting this to happen anytime soon\n* I asked about increasing frequencies by adding north south lines, such as a Parker Road to Buckner line that bypasses downtown\n   * The problem is, whenever you have a train going from cityplace/uptown to deep ellum station, it blocks trains going to or from pearl for 3 minutes\n   * This means DART cannot operate this kind of service as of right now\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSTATE POLITICS GETTING IN THE WAY OF TRANSIT:\n\n* Texas killed transit expansion across the state when they allowed sales tax to be used for property tax abatement or economic development\n   * This leaves no money for transit, since cities can only allocate 2% of their sales tax\n   * Any city with transit today has transit because they allocated their sales tax BEFORE they had any other way to spend it\n   * Transit didn't just stop expanding to new cities in DFW, but the whole state of Texas\n* Attempts have been made to pass a transportation choices act\n   * This would allow Texas cities to add a new transit tax that is EXEMPT from the 2% sales tax limit on municipal governments\n   * It would be completely up to the municipality and its voters, its a choice.\n   * Did not go very far in the state legislature, but did have some support from democrats and republicans\n* TxDot legally CANNOT spend a dime on public transportation\n   * any dollar TxDot gives to DART or other transit agencies is just money funneled through the Federal department of transportation\n      * This is money that could have only be spent on transit\n   * This limit is imposed on TxDot by the state constitution\n* Needless to say, a lot needs to change at the state level\n   * Texas hamstrings public transportation\n* Apparently, TxDot is starting to open up to public transportation more and more\n   * Though it seems like they have a long ways to go\n* DART thinks that TxDot and the state won't be friendly to public transportation until traffic gets so bad they won't have another choice\n   * its frustrating because we should be investing in public transportation to PREVENT LA levels traffic, but it looks like our state leaders will sleep on the issue until we get that crippling traffic. Only then will finally (hopefully) take transit seriously\n* Please vote \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMISC:\n\n* DART had to overcome a bus operator shortage to restore frequency and reliability to their service\n   * They were successful, roughly 7% of trips were being cancelled. Now its less than 1%\n   * HOWEVER, this came at a monumental effort, lots of money spent recruiting, increasing pay, and bonuses\n   * This is why DART has enough bus operators, but your local school district and other transit agencies do not. Other employers did not undergo this monumental recruiting effort\n   * It cost a lot of $$$\n   * As a result, one of the biggest barriers to the tier two bus network is expected to be hiring new bus operators. \n      * Its a tough job market right now (for the employers)\n* Police pay is now competitive, so they are expecting to be able to fill their police shortage\n   * However it will still take a while, but they expect to be able to do it\n   * Police pay was not competitive before (I assume before October, somewhere around there)\n* In a few months, DART will start the pilot program that connects homeless riding the system to resources so they don't use DART as a shelter\n   * Nonprofits will ride the trains to get homeless riders to shelters\n* Route 23 is doing very well\n   * That's why its getting a frequency promotion (duh)\n* Route 241 is still doing very well\n   * I think this should be a 15 minute all day route in tier two, but thats just me\n      * I don't know of any other 200 series route that gets over 2000 riders per day, but I also don't have access to the latest data\n\nWith that, since these posts tend to get a lot of attention, I wanted to let all of you know that I will be making my own recommendations for the city council elections coming up in May. I will be making recommendations for Plano, Richardson, and Dallas. My primary areas of concern will be how the candidates feel about land use, transit, and housing (in particular, land use and housing near transit) as well as walkability and really any issues relating to multimodal travel.",

                                "body": "That's a very complicated question. First, if you are using the orange line through Irving that is the lowest performing section of the light rail. Orange line from bachman to Parker road is generally pretty busy, especially during rush hour. North of bachman station it doesn't get a lot of ridership except at the airport station and belt line station and I think the north lake station does alright.\n\n\nThere's a lot that makes a station or route successful. Some of it is in DART's control, some isn't. Is it comfortable to walk to your bus stop? A lot of the DART service area makes for a miserable walking experience. It doesn't matter how good DART service is, if it sucks to walk to that will always hinder ridership. \n\nFrequency is important. The more frequent your bus is, the more people will use it. Even modest improvements to frequency in the past have led to pretty significant ridership gains. This makes sense when you think about it, a bus that comes every hour is hard to use, but a bus that comes very 15 minutes is a lot more convenient. Even if you are dependent on the bus and don't have other options, you will feel more inclined to travel more often if that bus is frequent. Higher frequency also leads to less crowding, so you are less likely to need to stand which could deter people from riding.\n\nThe good news is, these frequency improvements on the bus will boost ridership on the light rail, because the bus routes connect to the light rail. So if a connecting bus line becomes easier to use, \n\nDART could also provide more security on the light rail to make passengers feel more safe. They are working on this right now, it will almost certainly improve ridership.\n\nThey could add more bus routes and GoLink zones too. \n\nThe rest is really up to the city though. Near bus routes and light rail, make it safe to walk. Add new housing close to transit. Zoning can make a huge difference. DART can basically just run more service and more frequent service. Beyond that it's mostly up to the city\n\nDART's ridership is also just naturally going up right now due to pandemic recovery. It's been slowly but surely rising. I don't know when the pandemic recovery gains will plateau, but I don't think it's happened yet.",

They are exploring ways to enhance these junctions to achieve greater train throughput.\n\nApparently, back in 2009, when the first phase of the green line was launched, they attempted to run a 10-minute service. However, they encountered issues with maintaining reliability as trains were getting stuck in the tunnel, and they received numerous complaints from passengers. As a result, they switched to a 15-minute schedule.   \n\n\nThen, we learned that Nadine Lee, the CEO of DART, has a long-term goal to establish a 10-minute service for both the rail and frequent bus lines.   \n\n\nThat being said, don't expect 10 minute service anytime soon. It will take years to get to 15 minute all day service, who knows how far off 10 minute service is. However, its good to know that it can be done without D2.",

However, DART is looking to expedite this process by just looking at everything they are doing. I assume this involves changing around their financial plan and seeing how they can get more resources allocated towards operations  \n\n\nSo we don't really know how long the bus network improvements will take. DART will probably start making some improvements very quickly, but getting to tier two will take some time. I'm hoping for 5 years, but wouldn't be surprised if it takes a little longer. However, Rob Smith (service planning) seemed confident they could make tier two happen, and he said he wanted to get these improvements going before he retires (and he's retiring soon)",

This is coming from DART service planning, the board's role here will be to approve or reject this. I don't know their reaction to it. I agree though that some of the board just doesn't have the experience riding DART of us riders. I think they should be required to use DART a few times a week, buses and rail.\n\n\nIf you aren't impressed with tier two of the bus network, please let them know here:\n\nDART.org/futureprojects\n\nHowever, I did have the opposite reaction, especially for tier 2. I can tell you have very high expectations for DART, which is good\n\nBut for me personally, I thought tier 2 was too good to be true, we are finally gonna reach the point where almost no one ever has to wait more than 30 minutes for their bus. 15 minute headways on rail, 15 minute headways on frequent bus service, 30 minute headways on the coverage bus routes, and many coverage bus routes being promoted to frequent. I could not believe those headways. The ease of transferring (which I do a lot) will be so much better with those levels of frequency. \n\nI was shocked that DART thought this bus network would be possible in the future. DART is fitting this in with their existing funding as well, taxes aren't being raised or anything to fund this and they aren't creating new taxes to supplement their funding. \n\nThere's a few things not on this map detailed, such as the bus corridor improvement program. This was talked about at the meeting, and the plan there is to make infrastructure upgrades to improve bus reliability. This means signal priority at intersections so buses don't wait at red lights as much, queue jump lanes which let buses pass cars and go forward at the intersection before the cars get the greenlight, and even dedicated lanes. I can't detail that on this map, because DART is still studying where buses get the most delayed, which roads are the least reliable, and where they can spend their money to have the greatest impact. Staff said there's a lot of federal funding opportunities here too, so DART may not have to spend a whole lot of their limited budget to make these improvements.\n\n\nI will be making a post later detailing everything I've learned through my conversations with staff, and going into more detail than this map could.\n\nStill, give your suggestions to them. DART.org/futureprojects\n\nI would also like to know what you want out of the bus network.",

It's important to keep in mind this is a prototype, but it seems like a lot of these changes are expected to happen in 2024 from what I understand  \n\n\nI will be delineating headways as follows:\n\nPeak/midday/offpeak\n\nso if a route has headways of\n\n30/40/60 that means 30 minutes during peak periods, 40 minutes during the midday, and 60 minutes off peak (late night/early morning)  \n\n\nWith that out of the way, here are the changes I've observed:  \n\n\n***Southern Sector Improvements******:***\n\nRoute 13 (South Dallas, Fair Park, and Downtown) 15/20/30 -> 15/15/15\n\nRoute 101 (Medical district, Hampton station, red bird transit center)  15/30/30 -> 15/20/30\n\nRoute 104 (MLK jr, westmoreland station, Dallas mountain view college) -> 15/30/30 -> 15/20/3-\n\nRoute 108 (Camp wisdom to westmorland station) 15/30/30 -> 15/20/30  \n\n\nRoute 218 (Lawnview to Lake june, serves Pleasant Grove) 30/40/60 -> 15/20/30\n\n***Plano, Richardson, and Far North Dallas Improvements:***\n\nRoute 239 (serves DNT, legacy west plano, Addison, downtown Dallas) 30/40/60 -> 15/20/30\n\nRoute 241 (NW Plano Park and ride, coit, forest lane station) 30/40/60 -> 15/20/30\n\n883 east (UTD, Cityline, Renner) 30/30/30 -> 15/15/15 (I suspect this one might have more than 15 minute headways)\n\n  \n***Irving and Carrolton Improvements:***\n\nRoute 229 (downtown Irving, north lake college, downtown carrolton, Addison) 30/40/60 -> 15/20/30  \n\n\nRoute 230 (Airport area, Downtown Irving, Medical District, Downtown Dallas) 30/40/60 -> 15/20/30  \n\n\n***Garland, North Dallas, South Richardson Improvements***\n\nRoute 22, between forest lane and forest Jupiter station only, will go from 15/20/30 -> 15/15/15  \n\n\nRoute 200 (downtown garland, spring valley station) ->30/40/60 -> 15/20/30  \n\n\n  \nHonestly this doesn't look too different from the prototype they showed off at a board meeting months earlier. I already made a post about that, they are just making this official.  \n\n\nI'm expecting these changes to come maybe next year. Then the tier two changes (which I discussed here): [https://www.reddit.com/r/dart/comments/11sfi8j/this\\_changes\\_everything\\_tier\\_two\\_transit\\_network/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dart/comments/11sfi8j/this_changes_everything_tier_two_transit_network/)  \n\n\nwill probably come in around 5 years? We'll see. I sent an email asking for more clarifying details about the tier one and tier two system, so we will see.",

        "selftext": "So, I'm thinking about working a couple of hours at a different store because my current store doesn't give me enough hours. I also want to do this so that I can use dart to get to work, but now looking at it taking the bus might cost me more compared to just driving directly to my destination.\n\nHere's some context, the store that I originally work for is just half a mile away from my house, a 2 or 3 minute drive if I were to take my car. The other store that I'm going to work at is 3 mi away, a 10 minute drive according to Google. I drive a 2012 Prius c, a car that, according to google, gets 53 miles per gallon in the city. \n\nMore than likely if I were to work at this other store I would have a morning schedule, meaning that I'll probably be working 6:45am/ 7:00am to 4:00pm or 9:00am to 5:00pm. That also means that if I were to take the bus I will have to buy a full day pass, which will cost me $6 every day. I could also do single rides since I'm only taking the bus, but that will also come out to be roughly $5 since a single ride is $2.50.\n\nSince my Prius c supposedly gets 53 miles per gallon, there isn't really much incentive for me to use public transit. I would like to use the bus, but I'll be spending a lot more on bus fare. Like, if I were to take the bus 5 days a week, assuming that every work day I take two single rides to and from the my job, that will come out to be $25 per week. Every month I will roughly be $100. In contrast if I were to just drive my Prius to work I won't need to refuel in a month or two, since it will take 9 round trips to my job for my Prius c to burn through one gallon out of its 9.5 gal fuel capacity. With gas prices starting to cost around $2.50 (at the time of this post) that means that one round trip only costs me 27\u00a2.\n\n---\n\nThe only reason I can see myself taking public transit is to avoid a wear and tear on my Prius. Originally, I was planning to drive over to a nearby train station to catch a bus that takes me directly to the store that I am going to work at. That train station is only half a mile away as well, meaning that I'll be avoiding driving 5 miles everyday that I work. That means I'll save my car from driving 25 miles every week, or 100 miles every month, 1200 miles every year. Though, I'm not sure if that's a significant enough to make a difference.",

                "body": "For your situation, if you want to avoid driving to work the bus just doesn't seem to make sense. However, since your commute is so short if you wanna avoid driving, try using a bike. You get the benefit of killing 2 birds with one stone, you get exercise while commuting. It probably won't take that much longer than driving, and it will save a ton of money. The downside is, there might not be a comfortable bike path from your home to your work. It's worth looking into, I don't bike myself but try scoping out your commute on Google maps, see if you can stick to residential streets, trails, or something like that. I know people who would like through parking lots to avoid biking on 6 lane arterial roads.\n\nNow, I want to talk about the bus \n\n>Every month I will roughly be $100. In contrast if I were to just drive my Prius to work I won't need to refuel in a month or two, since it will take 9 round trips to my job for my Prius c to burn through one gallon out of its 9.5 gal fuel capacity. With gas prices starting to cost around $2.50 (at the time of this post) that means that one round trip only costs me 27\u00a2.\n\nDART has fare capping. A monthly bus pass costs, I believe, $92 (I don't know because I have a year pass)\n\nSo, if you spend $92 on fares, you get a monthly pass. You cannot spend more than $92 unless you are paying in cash. If you are paying by tapping your credit card, or through the go pass app, you can't spend more than $92\n\n>With gas prices starting to cost around $2.50 (at the time of this post) that means that one round trip only costs me 27\u00a2.\n\nYou gotta factor in wear and tear, and depreciation of your car. But since you already own the car, I wouldn't be surprised if it was cheaper to just keep driving \n\n>Since my Prius c supposedly gets 53 miles per gallon, there isn't really much incentive for me to use public transit.\n\nCorrect, the bus and train save you money if you don't already have a car because the cost of the DART pass alone is some peoples insurance. The yearly cost of a DART pass can be cheaper than maintenance, some repairs may cost you the equivalent of 2-3 DART passes. And then there's gas. \n\nBut even if you have a car, DART can also save you money if the trip is long, if parking costs money where you work, or if your employer subsidized or pays for your DART pass (something you should look into)\n\nIt's in all honesty tough for me to recommend the bus for you, unless you want to take it to replace lots of other trips as well. However, I do think it's worth a try. The bus is an acquired taste for many, it is a slower way to get around and especially when you are new to riding, you will encounter frustrations. Eventually, you learn to work around these frustrations and avoid them, you learn to love just being able to get around while existing and not having to think about driving. \n\nOne day, I had this pounding headache after work and I felt awful, and I had to get home. It dawned on me that if I drove that day, I would have to drive back even though I could barely focus on anything other than how bad my headache was. I would have been impaired while driving, and I would have had to exert even more mental energy that I just simply did not have that day. But instead of having to drive while dealing with all that, someone else took care of that for me because I can get home with just one bus route and a train ride. \n\nDART is not convenient for everyone. Some trips are reasonably fast (or even beat rush hour traffic), while others turn a 20 minute drive into  1 hour long trip. Different neighborhoods have different levels of transit access, there are winners and losers. But for me, DART was an acquired taste. You learn to make trips that are convenient and you learn to appreciate the added free time you get by still being able to engage on some other task while traveling. The more I used the bus, the more I was able to enjoy it. There was definitely a learning curve for me. It's my preferred way of getting around now.",

The streets and pedestrian amenities that impact DART's ridership (if it sucks to walk to your bus/train, you are less likely to walk to it) are controlled by the city.  \n\nTheres just so much working against DART that is completely outside of DART's control it makes it really really difficult to run a good transit system.",

But you better believe, as quickly as I point out the good things DART is doing, as soon as the board or CEO make a bad decision I'll be the first one to complain about it.\n\nA lot of the issues DART currently has were inherited, you gotta remember Nadine hasn't been CEO for very long. Same for Chief Cato, he hasn't even been chief of police for a year yet. I think he was hired 6 months ago? These things will take time to improve. However, so far the track record isn't bad. Cleanliness is improving, and DART was successful in hiring more bus drivers (at a time where many transit agencies are still struggling and so are the local school districts for their school bus drivers) so right now I'm pretty optimistic about DART and their leadership. That can change in an instant though, I'm always keeping up with their board meetings.\n\nI also do try to share more positive because.. well it makes my posts about DART more unique and they do deserve recognition for the good things they do and no one gives it. Dmagazine was right to complain that DART shut down in the winter storm last year, but Dmagazine never talked about how well DART did this year handling the winter weather. It's a shame, because that massive improvement went unreported. That's one reason why I try to be more positive about DART, I think people like reading the good news too",

But it should follow rules and timelines for permit reviews that the city and the agency had already agreed to. And given the importance of the Silver Line to the traveling public, it shouldn\u2019t take the better part of a year to get to yes or no and why.\n\nThis brings us back to the $36 million in Silver Line costs that DART could deduct from the $111 million in extra revenue that the transit agency had earmarked for Dallas last year. City Council members had already made plans to spend that money on an assortment of transportation projects, and they were blindsided by DART\u2019s announcement last month that it could reroute some of that money toward the Silver Line.\n\nLee said DART was trying to recoup costs for add-ons to the Silver Line plan that are not mandated by law but that city staffers requested to approve permits. Assistant City Manager Robert Perez denied in an interview that there was a quid pro quo.\n\n\nThe good news is that Dallas and DART may have reached a breakthrough of sorts. City and transit officials sat down Tuesday for a session mediated by Michael Morris, director of transportation for the North Central Texas Council of Governments. Morris said the group went through six or seven pages of costs to allocate them to DART or Dallas. NCTCOG offered to absorb some of those expenses.",

This could be fixed with more frequency. I miss a bus? No problem, 5-10 minutes til the next one. Shorten my commute by half an hour.

I think for most people I ask that is the main reason why they don't take public transit. After taking public transit a couple of times I quickly see that there are lots of people that just break the rules, panhandle, and tend to harass you here and there. It's nothing crazy but it does give the perception of public transit seem very unsafe. Plus with lots of stories of people getting mugged/ getting their phone snatched, I can see why people be hesitant on using public transit more.\n\nThe second reason that I personally don't use dart is because most places that I go to are pretty close by. I myself own a Prius so gas economy isn't that big of an issue for me, if anything taking public transit is going to cost me more than driving over. Plus there's a convenience of driving directly to my destination at any time of day or night. I could try riding my bicycle instead of driving my car, but in my neighborhood there tends to be lots of loose unneutered dogs and I've already been bitten a couple of times because of me trying to ride my bike, so driving is probably the safest way to get around, even more so at night. The only benefit I can see of taking public transit over me driving is eliminating the risk of getting into a car crash and avoiding wear and tear on my car.",

        "selftext": "I'm sure most of you by now have noticed that the double digit routes are more frequent than the 100 series or 200 series routes. For example, the route 241 will run at 30 minute headways while the route 22 runs at 15 minute headways. Single digit routes (1, 3, 5, and 9) run 15 minute headways all day, not just during peak periods.  \n\n\nHowever, what if I told you there were 2 additional core frequent routes that do not have the double digit numbering?  \n\n\nThis is done because of interlining. 2 bus routes will overlap, creating a more frequent bus route for the portion that does overlap.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iw2fd9b6z8ma1.png?width=1689&format=png&auto=webp&s=301359d8da0a2f46bec3f4db1b1816c2e348aad8\n\n  \nI've marked the route 200/202 overlap in red. The route 200 comes every 30 minutes, and so does the route 202. This means that if you have a route 200 arriving at say, :15, then you can have a 202 arriving at :30, then a route 200 arriving at :45. On the map, this route is blue, indicating that its headways are 30-60 minutes. However, the headways are actually 15-30 minutes due to the overlap. The red coloring was my addition, but I think DART should color this overlapping section in yellow  \n\n\n  \nThe other example of this is in Garland  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p41qnnbpz8ma1.png?width=572&format=png&auto=webp&s=53a0152d12295b0d9fc7e58c6cfca9df3f397eb9\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRoutes 251 and 203  overlap for a short amount of time. Yeah its not a long route but it still counts. In the plans for DARTZoom the route 251 was core frequent, but I they ended up just making it a local coverage route with lower headways in the end.",

You could also get to DFW, UTD, Fort Worth even. You could transfer to Amtrak or Greyhound or a lot of other Intercity bus operators. You could even get to uptown or west Plano.\n\nIt's just more convenient for everyone involved except for people who need it to get to love field, but that's a small airport so I think the easy orange line transfer to DFW would provide more potential ridership than a short bus/shuttle transfer to love field. My guess is most people probably aren't using it to get to love field because of how small of an airport it is.",

Vonlane sells itself as a luxury bus service, and having nice stops where you can wait at is a big part of that image (union station is the closest dart's got, but still not really luxury. Building a dedicated station doesn't make sense for the amount of riders they get.) A downtown hotel would be nicer, but they'd also have to get the agreements, which I feel like Vonlane would be working for (idk if they are though.) The original Houston route (which still also runs btw) didn't go anywhere near downtown. Why this is, idk. Maybe bc storing the bus is more difficult, maybe none of the downtown hotels agreed at first, maybe they have a lot of people trying to get a southwest flight, or maybe they're just stupid.\n\nEDIT: Vonlane should totally add a new stop in downtown, but unless they feel that that they need a second Houston-Dallas route, idk if they'll see the need, being a private company with busses that do sometimes sell out.",

No transit access at all, you are very far from the actual university and many off campus housing off coit and/or Renner. Hell, it could go to where the UTD buses go and that would be better.

        "selftext": "In the last phase 2 of DARTZoom meeting, DART said they will get feedback from the public on phase 2 this march.\n\n\n\nThere have been talks of promoting light rail frequency to 15 minutes in the midday. I would suggest doing 15 minute all day frequencies on the light rail.\n\n\nThe key cost barrier to improving light rail frequencies is not actually running more service on the light rail itself. Sure, that costs money, but bus routes need to connect to the LRT. \n\nIf you have a bus route that comes every 20 minutes off peak, that perfectly lines up with a train arriving every 20 minutes, creating what's called a timed transfer. This speeds up trips and makes traveling with DART more convenient. A bus that comes every 40 minutes hits every other train departure, but you can still time the transfer.\n\nWhich means promoting the trains to 15 minutes midday service requires improving the entire network. Every bus routes midday service will need to be improved, 40 minute headways will be 30, and 20 minute headways will become 15.\n\nAt night, many bus routes go to hourly and half hourly headways. This means, it's not required for DART to improve night service on buses if they have the light rail running 15 minute headways at night. \n\n\n\nWe may see significant system wide improvements on nearly every bus route if DART decides to improve LRT frequencies to 15 minutes off peak. However, DART will also promote certain bus routes further. I made a post about this topic already (https://www.reddit.com/r/dart/comments/106crgf/every_route_planned_to_potentially_get_more/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb)\n\nBeyond that, new bus routes and GoLink service are another possibility. Irving had much of its bus routes replaced by GoLink, but this didn't work in all cases. The mayor of Irving  and Nadine Lee (DART CEO) agreed that in Irving GoLink has not been an adequate service for the bus routes it replaced for all scenarios. They didn't fully explain why GoLink hasn't been sufficient, I don't know if it's capacity issues or something else. When GoLink service is overused it becomes really expensive to operate and fixed route becomes the cheaper option \n\n\nOn the topic of GoLink, DART may also combine GoLink zones. Rowlette and south Garland may become one zone, as well as Preston Hollow and Park cities. Plano is currently under a zone to zone pilot program, where all of the North Plano GoLink zones act as one. The pilot program is performing well, so I expect that to become a permanent change for Plano GoLink. There will be less division of GoLink zones, allowing for more zone to zone travel\n\nIn summary, we may potentially be hearing about the following in March\n-LRT frequency improvements\n-system wide frequency improvements\n-route specific frequency improvements, for routes that have performed really well\n-new bus routes\n-new GoLink service\n-golink zones merging together",

The link below discusses the program. \n\n[https://comptroller.texas.gov/economy/local/type-ab/](https://comptroller.texas.gov/economy/local/type-ab/)\n\nA lot of DART cities look at the revenue that places like Frisco, Allen, McKinney, etc can put towards their economic development projects due to being a type 4A or 4B organization and wish that they had that level of money to utilize. For example, Allen took in approximately 19.1 Million in 2017 that would have had to have been given straight to DART.   \n\n\n[https://www.cityofallen.org/1045/DART-Rail-Service#:\\~:text=Funding%20%2D%20DART%20participation%20requires%20the,service%20area%20for%20local%20funding](https://www.cityofallen.org/1045/DART-Rail-Service#:~:text=Funding%20%2D%20DART%20participation%20requires%20the,service%20area%20for%20local%20funding).\n\nSo, any City that is not feeling like it's receiving enough in services or doesn't see the value of DART  likely would look to a way to leave DART in order to start collecting the Sales Tax that they cannot obtain due to DART participation.  \n\nMr. Killen is likely explaining that if DART takes away the voice from their participating Cities there will be even more incentive to leave the system. Cities can already have a tough time working with DART due to DART's internal politics, and for Cities that aren't a priority for DART leadership, I could see if being a resourcing issue. The local City is giving away it's sales tax, but DART isn't really providing the same level of service to their area as other Cities. Then, when the City or local developers try to work with DART and DART says \"your plan is nice and all, but we'll need to take a 2/3rds majority vote and it doesn't pass then all your work and plans are just trash,\" it could leave a bad taste in the mouth of the local City.",

Mr. Killen was making the point that the suburban cities are wanting to change the voting requirements for certain issues to need 2/3rds support from the board. Mr. Killen is pointing out they it's hypocritical to want more of a voice in DART when you're going to the legislature looking for a way to leave DART.\n\nMy guess is he's actually referring to city council members from certain cities and not the city themselves.",

        "selftext": "Last meeting, Nadine Lee briefed the board about a potentially (key word: potentially) concerning legislation. \n\nWe don't have the exact details behind this. The deadline to file legislation for the upcoming legislative session is today. So today I'm going to be monitoring that.\n\n\n\nThe story behind this is Plano councilman Shelbie Williams asked a question that to be frank, is a fair question to ask. He wanted to know, how much money is DART spending in Plano. This is a valid concern, for as long as DART has been around there have been debates on \"who subsidizes who\". \n\nHowever it's not so easy to figure this out. Since DART is a network, transit improvements all access the network benefit everyone. Any bus route that connects with the red line is a benefit to Plano residents\n\nFurthermore, DART is currently spending a lot of money to bring the silver line to Plano. They aren't paying the price to operate it yet, but how do you factor that into the equation?\n\n\nThe board rightfully brings up how hard of a question this is to answer. DART's response to the councilman was to start this value of transit study to figure out how much value each city was getting and that is still a work in progress. One year passes, and DART hasn't given this councilman an answer because truthfully it's a hard question to answer. Not to mention, DART seems very likely to increase frequency on some Plano routes.\n\n\nAnd while the councilman recognizes it's a hard question to answer, in his mind DART dropped the ball on this one. He got in touch with representative Matt Shaheen, to file legislation that would require DART to disaggregate costs by member city allocation. \n\n\nThe board makes a good point, that we don't want the Texas state legislature to determine how DART spends its money. It's also a really complicated question to answer. I don't wanna speak too strongly against the legislation before we have seen it though, but I'm worried about what it will entail. I don't think our legislature is very transit friendly and I don't trust them to have our best interests in mind.\n\n\nI'll make a post about my ideas to provide more value to Plano in the future. There's certainly room for improvement.\n\n\nHere's a link to the meeting, if you wanna listen to the full discussion, click on item 13:\n\nhttps://dart.swagit.com/play/02142023-886\n\n\nShelbie Williams is also active on Reddit, so if you are reading this post.. Hello \ud83d\udc4b, I appreciate your efforts to get more transit for the residents of Plano. I still have fears for this legislation though, but I'm gonna wait and see. Feel free to flesh out your point of view on DART with a post, we'd love to hear from you.",

However a cop on most trains is doable. Certainly we will see a lot more\n\n-police are now being paid a competitive rate. Lots of applications are coming in, but the quality of many candidates is lower than expected. Many failing background checks and fitness checks. Fitness checks DART requires are more strict than what is actually necessary, so they are going to make the fitness checks easier and more fair. This should let more people get through the hiring process\n\n-8 new officers are being onboarded right now\n\n-lots of new marketing and out reach is about to be done to hire more security\n\n-contracting existing officers or security is being looked into as a temporary solution, while they hire police, which takes lots of time \n\n-DART's current police hiring troubles are not too different from other police departments\n\n-as another temporary solution, Nadine Lee noted that other DART employees (such as cleaners) being on the light rail creates a feeling of safety. More eyes on the scene always helps with safety, so hiring more cleaners to ride the trains is being looked at as a way to improve safety.\n\n-most common type of arrest was mental illness related arrests. I was pleased to find out these people are not taken to jail, but they are taken to Baylor, Parkland, other local hospitals, or this psychiatric hospital in DeSoto. It's called an arrest because they are taken to these hospitals against their will. Once they are at the hospital, their relationship with the police ends. I'm glad we aren't just putting the mentally ill in jail and locking them up, they need treatment in my opinion.\n\n\n-meadows institute pilot program to house homeless that try to use DART as a shelter will be starting soon\n\n-DART now sends police officers with the cleaners who clean the stations after hours, which is something I believe the cleaners requested a few months ago\n\n\nThe board was rather unanimous in their support for the current police chief, and commended his efforts for trying to get more officers. Hosanna Yemiru also emphasized the need to improve safety in ways that don't necessarily require police. She was always advocating for this but now especially when we have a shortage, it's something that needs to be looked into because DART has to work with what they have and what they can get and make the best of it.",

They will definitely try, but it's possible very few people take DART up on the offer. This was mentioned in the board meeting, but police will take up extra work when they are off, but they prefer to go somewhere like a mavericks game to provide extra security. and because there's a lot of need for police, and no one has enough right now, they can take up pretty much any job they want. So they will most definitely go for something easier - because they can. That was my understanding at least",

That's a great idea, and I remember hearing about the very basic conceptual plans shortly before I left in early 2021.\n\nThe whole idea that they're ever going to have a fully staffed police force is... laughable. DART has never fully staffed anything, except maybe bus, rail, and police dispatchers just because so few of them are actually needed for full functionality. Mechanics, operators, FEOs, LEOs, even managerial staff are always short, and only continue to function because hourly employees voluntarily sign up for overtime, and the salaried folks - for reasons that are BEYOND my comprehension - agree to take on the workload of two to three people for... brownie points? That is, if it isn't forced upon them with the threat of termination if they refuse.\n\nTrying to contract out LEO services to member cities' PDs is not going to work as well as they think. I feel that the word will get out quickly that DART overtime work is the bottom of the barrel for overtime work, and all of that is strictly voluntary. Sure, there will always be some who agree to take it, but will that be enough? Do we want cops on our trains who are grumpy about the work they got? It doesn't seem like the best plan, to be frank.",

With police it's a bit different, they have 100 vacancies, and budgeted enough money to do it. Although i could be wrong, maybe they had vacancies and were trying to hire more mechanics too.\n\nAnd there is new leadership that we got and Nadine Lee is great from what I can tell. Chief Cato is also the new police chief and he has a good track record with Mesquite, so there is reason to be optimistic.

        "selftext": "On Tuesday, 2/28, 6 pm, DART will host public comments as they do every board meeting. Many are taking this chance to advocate for more service span on the silver line (early morning and late night service)\n\n\nThe board meetings happen here: \n\n1401 Pacific Ave,\nDallas, TX 75202\n\nRight of Akard station. DART headquarters.\n\n\nCurrently, the silver line is planned to run from 9 am to 9pm on weekends, and terminate at 10 pm on weekdays. At the last silver line meeting, lots of us suggested increasing the service span of the silver line to DART. However, we got a lot of push back from Dallas councilwoman Cara Mendelsohn, who went around the room telling people to oppose late night service.\n\n\nI firmly believe all DART services should run until midnight at minimum. To me, it makes no sense for your connecting bus to run until midnight, but for your train to end service at 9 pm. We need to take care of workers who work late night hours and don't have flexibility in their schedule.\n\nIf you wish to speak on other transit topics, feel free to do that as well. You can talk about frequency, service span, or any other topic related to DART. \n\n\nAfter the meeting, we can go grab a bite somewhere and discuss transit/DART :) lots of restaurants nearby",

        "selftext": "first, I will describe frequencies in the following format: rushour/midday/night  \n\n\nSo, if a route has frequency of 15/20/30 thats every 15 minutes during the rush hour, 20 during the midday, 30 at night.  \n\n\nNext, phase 2 of DART zoom is not meant to be done all at once. It is supposed to be a goal network that DART gradually moves into. So, I will categorize my improvements into categories. Within each priority bracket, the priorities are   \n\n\nPriority #1  \n\\-LRT is now 15 minute all day  \n\\-Core Frequent bus routes go from 15/20/30 to 15/15/30\n\n\\-Local coverage 200 series bus routes go from 30/40/60 to 30/30/60 minimum. Ones where demand is higher at night can have 30 minute all day frequencies (too bad I have no idea which routes would meet this criteria)  \n\\-TRE Sunday service  \n\\-Silver line would have a regular service span once built (5 am to midnight)\n\n\\-GoLink zone consolidation. Golink Rowlett and GoLink south Garland become one Zone. North Plano GoLink's become one zone. Rylie and Kleberg become one zone. Golink Person Hollow and Park Cities become one zone. Keller Springs and Northwest Carrolton combine. This is probably going to happen soon anyways\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPriority #2\n\n\\-Silver line frequency improved to at least 30 minute all day\n\n\\-Express buses are restored to 15 minute rush hour headways  \n\\-Route promotions ensue. Some 200 series routes are promoted to 100 or core frequent status. The best performing 100 series routes are promoted to core frequent. Many core frequents are promoted to 15 minute all day. \n\n  \nThe map below, to the right, includes the system wide frequency imrpovements i outlined in priority #1, as well as bus route promotions:\n\n[Original \\(left\\), my concept promotions \\(right\\)](https://preview.redd.it/kw1fsmsba3ia1.png?width=1716&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6998cacb48308cc7e400662aeb9e446290200f4)\n\nThese frequency improvements wouldn't come all at once. Routes like the 239 and 13 would be first in line for a route promiton due the fact that those routes get very busy. Not all of these frequency improvements are super important. The system wide frequency improvements (such as 200 series routes going from 30/40/60 to 30/30/60 and LRT being 15 minute all day) would happen all at once\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPriority #3\n\n\\-***Rapid ride bus routes*** (enhanced bus corridors or even BRT) The primary considerations for my personal rapid ride network are:  \nroutes 15 (buckner), 16 (ferguson), 20 (northwest highway), 22 (forst lane), and 38 (ledbetter)\n\n\\-New cross town express bus corridors  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9xfmf0jnb3ia1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=345551812b4034374bb7607c8283b5bccdf79e9f\n\n\\-New local bus routes. Primarily in Plano and Irving, especially Irving. Irving's new bus routes have been performing verrry well, but golink has been overused and isn't providing the access DART wants. East-west connectivity has been damaged by DartZoom, so new east-west routes in Irving are very important and we are likely to see them. \n\n\\-New 883 bus route. This is a fun idea, the 883 does extremely well, a new 883 north route serving the Jack Hatchell transit center would serve all the new apartments, walmart 7 days a week, and connections to other DART buses/golink. This is also a big win for Plano.  \n\n\nPriority #4\n\n\\-Central Link Streetcar\n\n\\-M-line modernization  \n\\-M-line extension to mockingbird station\n\n\\-m-line extension to farmers market\n\n\\-10-15 minute headways on new modernized M-line and oak cliff streetcar\n\n\\-Elimination of bus route 209, which would be replaced by modernized m-line.",

Also, buses just serve more areas. They may not be as glamorous, but they definitely get the job done. \n\nThere used to be bus lanes along Harry Hines (you can see the remnants of the markings still on the road in some areas), it would be nice if the city of Dallas and others could work with DART to create bus lanes where it makes sense to speed up the buses again. To my knowledge the only in operation bus lanes in Dallas county are the ones downtown",

Bonus, you can't go wrong with a torta from [La Hechizera Tortas](https://www.tortaslahechizera.com/). \n\nVictory Station has so many good options: [Hero](http://www.herobyhg.com/), [Mesero](https://www.mesero.net/), [Billy Can Can](http://www.billycancan.com/). Bonus if you don't go on a game day, it'd be less crowded that way.\n\nAt West End Station is [3Eleven Kitchen and Cocktails](https://3elevendallas.com/) good? I've never been, I'm curious.\n\n Akard/St Paul/Pearl Arts District Stations I'm just going to list out my options here: [Crafty Irishman](https://goo.gl/maps/rxBzCG6gL6rDqw859), [City Tavern](https://goo.gl/maps/aCxmM2S3S3KmukcQ8), [Frankie's](https://goo.gl/maps/h4mLX6xmPQzjbb347). \n\nDeep Ellum Station is where you go hog wild. I'm going to pretend some of my favorites never closed, like July Alley, Wits End, or The Green Room. But, if I was going to current bars I would hit up [Electric Shuffle](https://electricshuffleusa.com/), [Twilite Lounge](http://www.thetwilitelounge.com/), [Dot's](http://dotshophouse.com/), [Adair's](http://www.adairssaloon.com/)\n\nI would end my bar crawl on Fair park Station, at either [Eight Bells Alehouse](https://goo.gl/maps/tLYnYwDYcZhAfCBWA) or [Craft and Growler](https://www.craftandgrowler.com/?utm_source=local&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gmb). Great places to question my life choices.",

        "selftext": "Once again, I gotta give a huge shout-out to Comet's For Better Transit for their strong showing. Keep up the good work.\n\nToday I learned that I, along with the other transit advocates, are actors paid by DART to show up to meetings. I did not know this, and after the meeting, I asked DART where my paycheck was. \n\nWe got accused of being paid DART shills because we were advocating for later and earlier hours on the silver line. At the start of the meeting, DART showed the current service plan (30 minutes peak, 60 off peak, 6am-10pm) but this time, they mentioned that they are considering extended hours.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised, DART seems to be in the process of looking into the silver lines service plan and potentially improving it. No doubt thanks to the good work at the UTD meeting. \n\n\nWe are gonna need to keep up the advocacy though because we made new enemies tonight. We thanked DART for considering later service and frequency, but Cara Mendelssohn went around coaching her constituents on what to say. She was whispering to them, telling them to say no to later hours. And that's what they did. People lined up to oppose transit riders being able to get around at night. One claimed she was concerned for her kids safety if the trains run later at night. I don't know, maybe don't let kids go outside unsupervised past midnight? That's your bigger issue, not the train. \n\nDART stood their ground, saying that they will take a lot of factors onto extending service hours, including who the silver line may serve in the future. I love this answer, because if you get off work at 11 PM or need to catch a flight at 6 am the silver line doesn't serve you, so ridership is low. By making that service available you give people a chance to plan their trips around it. \n\n\nThere was a lot of property tax elitism at the meeting, a lot of residents saying something to the effect of \"I've been paying property tax for years and I don't want later service\" or \"you need to listen to us because I've been living here for 20 years paying property tax\"\n\n\nGuess what, if you are a renter you pay property tax too. Your rent is used so your landlord can cover property taxes. Your rent pays into your school district and your city. You also pay sales tax.\n\n\nWhen a resident accused us of being paid DART actors, and that's when DART staff had to tell them to lay off the personal insults. After that, the meeting stayed civil.\n\nCara pointed out that we apparently don't have a \"long term buy in\" to the community,  the implication was that our opinion didn't matter. I was offended though because she's basically trying to minimize the value of our inputs and she doesn't know a damn thing about us. I live and work in the service area. I pay rent, and I pay sales tax. I use DART on a daily basis, bus and rail. My input does matter. I'm a UTD Alumni, not a student and even if I was a student who cares? That's not relevant to the discussion. She attacked us for being students. Not all of us were even students.\n\nI was in complete shock at what Cara Mendelssohn said. I you are a student she views your voice as less important. Which is just absurd, UTD is largely a commuter school. Lots of people go there because they grew up in Dallas or Richardson and it's just the nearby university that won't charge them out of state tuition. Not only that but local companies go to career fairs and higher UTD students. So we end up working in Dallas and Plano too. None of this matters though because students pay taxes to Dallas and DART too. And Comets for Better Transit includes alumni who live and work in Dallas.\n\nSo I took offense at her comment, she's allowed to disagree with me but the elitism hurt. \n\nWhen I talked to DART staff after the meeting, they reassured us that our opinions do infact matter. If you pay rent your opinion matters. Being a home owner doesn't give your voice more weight. And students also deserve to have their voice heard.\n\n\nI thank DART for considering all opinions, and for considering more frequency and hours on the silver line. We also had a good laugh with staff about the paid actor comment.\n\nNo matter what a council woman says, your input does matter and your voice does deserve to be heard. I have concerns because her district has a lot of UTD students and she's supposed to represent them. Yet she showed today that she doesn't value their opinions.\n\nWe got attacked by the NIMBYs and they didn't think our opinion mattered for one reason or another. They made it a point to seem more important to us. Their comments often felt personal, they did not like our presence at the meeting. All I'm doing is making sure someone can get home from their midnight job.",

Here's some that I've thought of that are feasible and should not cost as much as developing a new line.\n\nWhy not a direct DART shuttle from Victory to EBJ Union Station as a 1-car train going from station to station on a 20 minute frequency? It would speed up most transfers as you wouldn't need to wait at West End anymore. The same thing could be applied to Deep Ellum and Cityplace/Uptown (however both are unlikely because it may not meet ridership quotas). \n\nAnother interesting service could be a skip-stop service during rush hour only on the Red/Orange line segment north of Dallas. DART (with exceptional signalling systems and coordination) could inaugurate a Red Line service that bypasses the lower-used stations and can utilize crossovers to overtake trains at stations and run at higher speeds, maybe on 45 minute frequencies heading into downtown to simplify operations. It would stop this skip-stop operation at SMU/Mockingbird and run local into downtown, terminate at Cedars and then run Not In Service back to Parker Road. \n\nThe same kind of skip-stop service could be offered with the Green Line between North Carrollton and Victory, with the train terminating at Fair Park before running Not In Service back to North Carrollton, also on a 45 minute frequency only inbound. \n\nLet me know what you think and how I can improve it.",

Dallas, Plano, Irving, Garland, Richardson, Carrolton. And I'd like to get Farmers Branch, Rowlette, and Addison as well but those are lower priority due to population. Highland Park, University Park, Cockrell Hill, and Glenn Heights have the lowest priority.\n\nThere are also non-member cities. Duncanville, Mesquite, Frisco, and many more. Having endorsements for these would be really good too because that would enable more access.\n\nI alone can't make an endorsement list for all these cities.

Leave a comment and I'll get in touch with you via reddit dms (discord or Twitter works better let me know in a private message) your priority list doesn't need to be the same as mine, so pick whichever city you want.\n\nI want some sort of justification for why you endorsed a candidate. You may not be able to find all the information you need online, so try watching old city council meetings or just asking the candidates some questions. \n\nIf you do sign up for a city, make sure you're committed to doing the research. If you aren't sure you will be able to go through with this, leave the slot open for someone who is sure.\n\n\nIf you have any questions, please let me know. This is a community effort, so feel free to make posts about the candidates you're researching. I'm also okay with multiple people researching the same city, but if possible I'd prefer you put your effort towards a city that no one else is looking into. It's really your choice.",

A longer roof would go along way, I don't see this one providing much protection at all.  \n\n\nI also don't know if a 1 seat bus shelter is ever really a good idea.

The idea is that it is easier to retain existing customers than to attract new ones, and by making DART better for existing riders it will become more attractive to new customers while also getting existing riders to not leave and to use the service more.  \n\n\nShe's also transitioning DART into an operations focused agency now that the promised rail network is almost complete (just silver line and then its done. This means focusing on operating the system we do have really really well rather than focusing on rapid expansion. More service, more security, more cleanliness, and more reliability is how I understand this goal as she brings up those items a lot and those items are also what customers demand the most on DART's surveys.  \n\n\nHere's some other non-podcast content Nadine Lee has been in:  \n\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAQYcoLoWts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAQYcoLoWts)\n\n\\-This one is interviewing several CEO's at once, not just Nadine.

Nadine speaks 20 minutes, 40 seconds in. Notice how she says D2 is paused right now. She was skeptical of doing D2 10 months ago, and was already suggesting DART free's up its cashflow to deal with more immediate needs.\n\n\\-She notes low income households spending a large portion of their income on cars, when financially it doesn't make sense, because DART is not competitive enough for them  \n\\-She reiterates that customer retention is more effective than customer acquisition  \nIf you have anymore podcasts or videos where we hear from Nadine Lee, let me know. I know I'm missing at least one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd Nadine Lee, if you are reading this (or anyone at DART who can contact Nadine) continue your public engagement and please do an Ask Me Anything here on this subreddit!

        "selftext": "Last week, my friend and creator of this subreddit, u/NomadicNom, broke the news that D2 was delayed.  \n\n\nWe actually learned this information at the UT Dallas silver line meeting, just chatting with the DART officials after this meeting. We got a pretty massive info dump that goes beyond the D2 delay. A lot of it is stuff we kind of sort of already know, but it was still interesting to hear.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's the basic rundown, before I get deep into the details:\n\n\\-New LRT Vehicles\n\n\\-BRT\n\n\\-Unified signaling system for the light rail system\n\n\\-Union Station upgrades and mobility hub\n\n\\-Unified signaling system on the light rail system\n\n\\-600 new buses (according to my notes anyways, not sure about the exact number)\n\n  \nThe new buses item is inline with statements Nadine Lee has made on podcasts before, about us needed more buses to serve a 700 square mile service area. She wants DART to own and operate more than 1,000. If DART buys 600, or even half of that, then the DART buses would start to have a really strong presence in the service area.  \n\n\nFirst he made a big deal about Union station. He said that it was going to transform into a mobility hub, and it will be \"activated\" as he said. It will also apparently one day connect to Waxahachie commuter rail.\n\nI was curious about the Waxahachie commuter rail. I have no idea if this will actually happen, how it will be funded, or who would operate such a line. But after doing more research, I found out that the North Texas Central Texas Council of Regional Governments is planning a Waxahachie line. IDon't know where the funding comes from (I know its not from DART). So keep that in mind, its not a DART project.\n\n  \nSo, where have we all heard this before? Long time ago, I made a post about the TAM, the transit asset management. In my post titled \"BRT is coming\" I talked about some maintenance DART needs to do. But most importantly, they had a $900 million dollar shortfall  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[600 million costs](https://preview.redd.it/qbtfga3jzafa1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=67fbe1c0df1228ef7d0512bb90488ca42c44915c)\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bfcvz0l9xafa1.png?width=1079&format=png&auto=webp&s=298475ed91d836da3b2e5863eff6972c7af92b1a\n\nNow, this shortfall is NOT as bad as it seems. They had that budget surplus  from the pandemic. That covers about $250 million (I believe? not a precise guess but in the ballpark) The TRE upgrades are shared costs with Trinity Metro, thats another $150 million.  \n\n\nRemember the D2 delay? This budget shortfall is where that money is going to. DART was hundreds of millions of dollars short of being able to do this, and by delaying D2, they have enough money to do all of this and more. The money to solve DART's problems was found, but at a huge cost (delaying D2).   \n\n\nLittle did I know, this presentation about the transit asset management plan would go on to be so important.  \n\n\nTomorrow, there will be a transportation meeting at city hall, I was expecting the D2 delay to be announced there but I'm not so sure anymore . It looks like they will talk about Union station though, and the convention center.  \n\n\nWe could use all of these items though, especially bus corridor improvements and passenger facilities.  Our stations and bus shelters aren't the greatest.",

Those of us on the freight side call it the Waxie (pronounced wock-zee) branch, and the BNSF has some pretty frequent traffic on it already. I don't know what the track conditions are like, but I do know it's good enough that the BNSF can run trains with high quantities of hazardous material, which requires pretty good track.",

The thing is they actually do clean the trains throughout the day, but mess accumulates quickly and if someone spills their soda or tosses their burger mid ride there's not a ton that xns be done until that train reaches it's final destination. At that point, it dwells, the cleaners board and they clean up before the train has to depart again (which won't be terribly long). Stations get cleaned every night and different stations receive a different number of cleanings throughout the day. Still, like you said the outside isn't always clean and they could do better cleaning the exterior. Cloth seats also suck for cleanliness because it's harder to tell if the cloth seats are dirty or not. In the morning I find the trains interior to be clean. Vandalism is definitely an issue as well.\n\nSecurity gets a D from me. Security presence is lacking, but there's cameras at all the stations and light rail. On peak there's always lots of riders, so you always feel safe. Stations like west end always have a good security presence. The orange line is the poorest performing line ridership wise once you get past bachman, so it's going to inevitably feel the most unsafe. Red line generally feels safe enough due to it's higher ridership. Green line I've had a disproportionately large amount of issues with.\n\nThe reason security isn't lower is because it's clear that the presence is increasing. There is a plan to implement a security surge for 2 years while DART highers back it's police force. The plan is to execute contracts and agreements with service are police departments. Hiring is going well but the issue is, due to training requirements set by the state, it takes a while before a new hire can actually start work. Even if DART hires a new fare enforcement officer today, it's going to take a lot of time before they are actually checking fares on the system. So the plan is to pay the member cities to have their cops ride the light rail until their hiring is complete.\n\nAdditional cleanings are being planned as well. I'd be interested in what your thoughts are 6 months to a year from now, because these plans seem good but who knows if/when they will be implemented and if they will deliver.",

It's so expensive to buy a car just to prepare for an emergency type situation, which may never even happen, or where Uber or even something like car share (which is not widespread yet) might get the job done just fine\n\nYou don't need to own a car, I think what you're trying to say is it's a good idea to still know how to drive, which is fair in some circumstances. You still may want to travel somewhere with bad/no transit, but if you make these trips rarely you're better off renting a car on a need to use basis. Infact people already do rent cars for different trips anyways. People rent U-hauls to move. People rent campers and trucks even if they already have a car. \n\nSo I agree (even though you didn't say it explicitly) it can be helpful to know how to drive, but if the transit system is truly top notch or even just \"very good\" it's pretty hard to justify car ownership especially because you can free yourself of car payments, gas, insurance, parking and maintenance costs.

But you're right, even just reducing cars is a win! \n\nMy biggest pet peeve with DART is that every line goes through downtown, so the only time it's convenient for me is if my destination is in or on the way downtown. If I want to go across town, it'll be 2-3x as long as driving. Hopefully, the Silver line will help fix this issue. I also recently saw that the D2 project is delayed, which is disappointing. One solution that would help the travel times is to create express trains that only stop once downtown and don't have to deal with car traffic since it would be underground. I'm not very confident about that happening in the next 10 years, though.",

We asked why, and they cited a lot of reasons, from not getting building permits on time, pandemic related issues, supply chain related issues, and more\n\nA few unrelated things DART announced. We already knew all of this from the board meetings, but in case you missed it:\n\n-DART said they will start locking elevators at night soon to help keep them clean and to stop homeless from blocking them. This was talked about in a board meeting a while ago, but I hope it happens soon for those who need elevator access. A specific time/date was not mentioned but this should in my opinion be a huge priority because if an elevator is unusable, for many that means the entire station is unusable\n-they are increasing security\n-they are going to launch a pilot program to connect homeless on the system with resources, so they don't use DART as a shelter. I really love this one, I hope it works.\n\n\n\n\nDuring the public comments, Comet's For Better Transit (a UTD student organization) and even some residents kept the discussion focused on the service. They kept saying that the headways and service spans were just a baseline, and not final. Freight does not impact how late the service can run and it is not a limiting factor preventing better headways. They said they could do better than hourly, and better than half hourly. In order for them to increase the frequency, they need board approval. DART staff agreed with concerns about the silver lines service. \n\nPeople complained that the silver lines service pattern was useless for catching early morning or late night flights. UTD students complained that the current service span that ends service around 9 pm is going to make the silver line useless for students with night classes. DART staff kept emphasizing that the service plan could change before the silver line is completed.\n\nOne of my favorite moments was when an older Richardson resident asked if the service plan of running hourly headways and ending service after 9 pm was done to appease NIMBYs in Far North Dallas. They said no this was just a baseline, but he also suggested that if the public wants  a better service plan then they need to make their voices heard and the implication was that if we didn't then the NIMBYS, who are against late night service, would win.\n\n\nDART employees kept emphasizing that if the service plan is to change, we need to bring our message to the board of directors. They showed us a calendar of the board meetings and told us to show up and leave a public comment. The staff said that it's up to the board to increase service span and/or frequency.\n\n\nThe entire discussion was dominated by questions about frequency and service span, which you love to see because it just as easily could have been dominated by NIMBYs complaining about who knows what.",

I understand that the majority of Arlington is built out, meaning a rail connection from DFW Intl' to Centerpoint to the entertainment complex to Old Town/UTA would require some likely destruction of buildings and possibly homes, barring a very expensive subway. This would definitley be a difficult decision that the community would need to come to an agreement about, and is sure to upset some.\n\n2. I understand that many Arlingtonians may feel the juice is not worth the squeeze and do not want to increase taxes to join Trinity Metro or build their own rail. They live in a car suburb for a reason.\n\n3. You may *also* feel that it is not the city of Arlingtons job to cater to the whims of the rest of the Metroplex. We are supposed to all be rugged individualist Texans, are we not? You got yourself here, you get yourself out.\n\nI spent part of my teenage years living in southern Denton County. I remember when the Green Line and the DCTA A-Train were under construction. I also remember the vitriolic NIMBYism that overtook the area when the trains were almost completed. People complained of property values, taxes, and construction costs. It was like a wild-eyed aggravation from adults, and rather than seeing progress like most younger people did, they treated the DART line like an unwelcome invader. I personally could not understand it.\n\nAnd finally, a friend of my parents finally said it. I brought up how excited I was for the trains to open, because I wouldn't need a car to go downtown, and I wouldn't need to sit in traffic on 35E anymore. And that individual stated, \"The train will let people come here, who I don't think should be here.\" And then I got it. It came down to prejudice, and not wanting POC from *scary South Dallas* to be able to spend a couple of bucks and get to our town. The distance, and the toll roads, and the police departments were all there to keep *them* away from *our* stuff. And now that didn't matter.\n\nI get it Arlington. \n\nIn answer to #1, you were more than willing to knock down the minority neighborhood that sat where AT&T stadium currently sits. #2, while your taxes will increase, yes, the city also gains from increased access to the entertainment complex in addition to transit oriented development (which has happened next to most of the DART rail stations, including the ones in Denton). #3, not allowing a locally connected transit line is wanting your cake (the money generated from Six Flags, Hurricane Harbor, Globe Life, Texas Live, and AT&T) and wanting to eat it too: \"They can all take the freeways to get home, and if they drink and drive, fuck em, not my problem.\"",

It's only used as a car replacement (not talking about park and rides, where dart absolutely is successful) when people are either too poor to afford a car, with the occasional hippy and person who lives at a dart station and works near another. If you complain about waiting an hour for a bus, the response here isn't \"damn we need more buses\", it's \"why aren't you driving? Did you get a DUI?\" or if you don't have a car, it's \"grow up and buy a car.\"",

Beverly Hills lost their unholy minds when LA Metro proposed to build a line to the beach that ran under their town. They spent *YEARS* blocking construction in court, throwing every excuse in the book. One of the highlights was \"The train will run under Beverly Hills High School, which will cause seismic activity to get worse and make the school fall into a sink hole (which would have more to do with the oil actively being drilled nearby than a train, but still hilarious).\n\nUltimatley what it came down to is, \"We moved over here to get away from the black people in South Central over there, and if the train is built now they can spend $3 to take the train, rob us, and leave. Or steal our daughters.\" Same shit as ever. And honestly, in DFW I think it's some variation of the same, except replace South Central with Oak Cliff or the 5 Points Neighborhood.\n\nFrisco is another one. Definitley would be helpful to have a line up there, but you its never gonna happen. I think DART and TexRail need to invest in more regional rail similar to LA Metrolink or Chicago Metra to make the transit system more efficient. We have plenty of old rail lines sitting unused through the metroplex that we can try to refurbish.",

        "selftext": "I was waiting for u/NomadicNom to make that D2 post, I really wanted to see what all of you thought and well, I cant say I'm surprised. I was told DART is going to present this to Dallas city council soon, maybe next week. That's probably when we were supposed to hear the news. But you got it early because you follow this subreddit and we do our best to find out as much as we can about DART :)  \n\n\nLets discuss the delay itself now. Something I've noticed and worried about with D2 is how its not as critically needed as it was pre-pandemic. Downtown Dallas travel demand is way down, and DART just isn't suffering the same capacity issues on the red line they used to.   \n\n\nI was looking at multiple D2 service plans DART made, and to be honest, I'm not impressed.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/29fxask7qaea1.png?width=586&format=png&auto=webp&s=c10faa5a444bcea062ec547cb3d90b93a385c741\n\n  \nThis service plan just adds one insert train to handle the Plano to Dallas traffic.   \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uf6x2vuiqaea1.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d7fae360b2c0f02512ad5f62b88fb8c8114be5e\n\n  \nHere, they add a new line (they called the purple line) that runs from Bachman to Buckner rush hour only, with 30 minute headways   \n\n\nThese service plans are, in my view, not worth the $2 billion investment. So why are the service plans so bad when they could be so much better?  \n\n\nIn the last board meeting on [item 15, 12 minutes in](https://dart.swagit.com/play/01112023-539), Patrick Kennedy states that we need to start making improvements to the bus network now so we aren't waiting until 2045 for capital reserves to accrue just to spend that money on a high cost capital intensive project that starves the operational budget. Staring the operational budget prevents good and frequent coverage on the bus network.  \nWhat I'm getting at is, DART would be starving their operational budget of additional funding if they built D2 today and thats *probably* why DART's service plans for D2 are so weak. It may have taken years before we actually got a very frequent rail network after D2. Not to mention, DART still needs to make frequency improvements on their bus network.  \n\n\nIf you wanna know what DART will spend their money on in the meantime, [check out this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dart/comments/wermbs/bus_rapid_transit_is_coming/). Nadine also gives us some insight on this podcast [right here](https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/commentary/2021/12/16/what-is-darts-future/), where she discusses wanting to operate over a thousand buses for the service area. You'll notice how she wants to shift DART to be more of a operational and service focused agency rather than an expansion and construction focused agency. You'll also notice that about 22 minutes and 30 seconds in, she shares her skepticism with D2 and she asks the question \"If we pause D2 for a few years, what does that do for our cashflow and what does that free us up to do?\" One thing she brings up is that she wants DART to have over 1,000 buses because Nadine believes we need a lot more buses to serve a 700 square mile service area than what we currently have (which is based and true)  \n\n\nWith all of this in mind, I currently ***cautiously*** believe that delaying D2 is the right decision. Much of my thoughts are just speculation, don't put too much weight into them. I could be wrong. I'm not an expert in DART finances. I'm just some guy on the internet speculating. Nadine Lee also really genuinely wants to see DART improve, but we just don't have all the details on what DART's plan is now that D2 is delayed. That's really important for evaluating if this was a good decision or not. That's why I'm only cautiously optimistic for now. \n\n  \nBefore I form a final opinion, I need to hear their justification (to see if my guess about capital spending starving their resources for service and operations is correct) and I need to see what delaying D2 allows them to do.  \n\n\nI welcome any disagreement in the comments. I'm sure this will be my most controversial post yet.",

One of the main weaknesses of D2 was the argument that it would add capacity and decrease headways (true) whilst not actually increasing headways beyond what is already possible with existing infrastructure (albeit with more reliability). The Silver Line will already suffer from half hour peak/hourly off-peak headways, I think spending the next decade building ridership with improving service and pushing more TOD will do far more than adding to the infrastructure burden in an endless chase for federal matching funds for capital expansion.",

I'm sure that DART has lots of good ways to use that money that will benefit the system, possibly even more than D2 would have, but for a project started in the 2010s to dig around 2? 3? miles of rail to be pushed to the 2040s is absolutely farcical. The whole project already started to feel a bit unserious after all the back and forth over where the alignment would come out. I wish we could just build shit on any kind of timescale faster than geologic.\n\nAgain, I don't doubt that DART has better ways to use the money right now, but for me personally this is extremely disappointing. Regardless, I'm of course rooting for us to see some huge returns on the other investments into the network that this money will make!\n\nEdit to add: I wonder if we hadn't embarked on the Silver Line project, would we have D2?

It gets the job done, not a super direct route. \n\nBut it's pretty good for traveling from say, downtown Garland station to firewheel mall. It's okay at getting you from Arapaho station to firewheel mall. If you live off Arapaho road is a good connection to the red line. If you live south of fire wheel it's a good connection to the blue line.\n\nIts also good for traveling to any businesses on belt line, and connecting those apartments it passes by to the Addison transit center.\n\nNot all routes are necessarily designed to be fast at running their whole route. A good example of this is route 17, which connects LBJ/central station to SMU mockingbird station. This is a bit of an extreme example, the 238 still works as a way to get to downtown Garland from Arapaho station, but no one is ever going to use the route 17 to go from LBJ to mockingbird. \n\nAs you get used to the buses more you'll learn what they are good for and when you stick to that it works really well. And they are still generally okay for traveling almost anywhere in the service area, with some exceptions. I'm excited to see the bus service get better",

After the meeting, one of the lead speakers said that DART had recently made a big decision: \n\nThe D2 project has been delayed another 10 years, and the whole process would likely need to start over when DART takes another look at it. Failure to acquire much of the subway segment right-of-way was cited as one part of why the project could be given an indefinite hiatus (as opposed to simply dragging out the existing process for more time). The current chosen alignment may need to be scrapped. A future re-alignment will likely attempt to consider Dallas's redevelopment efforts in the southern portion of the downtown area (Convention Center, I-30 deck parks, and other nearby structures). \n\nIn the meantime, DART plans to focus on using funds for improvements to the existing system, many of which can be seen [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dart/comments/107z81w/summary_of_improvements_dart_is_working_on/). However, light rail frequency will continue to pose a problem, as the lack of D2 means that the downtown transit \"mall\" will still carry all four DART light rail lines and by extension will continue to bottleneck the rest of the system. \n\nWhat's y'all's thoughts?",

But if at 10 pm you're waiting 30 minutes for your core frequent bus, or 30 minutes for your light rail, I feel like we should focus on that before we focus on improving rush hour service. We say 15 minutes on the light rail is not good enough and I agree, but before we push for those improvements, shouldn't we make sure we aren't waiting for 30?\n\nAnd same goes for weekend service.

It doesn't need to be taken away from Dallas and it doesn't need to take away from other improvements being made. It's money they would otherwise not have and because some of these new routes would go into Dallas or Garland or other existing cities. \n\nI don't see how Mesquite joining DART and getting maybe 5 new routes, an express route, and GoLink, would hurt the reliability of the route 28 in west Dallas. Infact it might help Dallas residents who live in Pleasant Grove because much of their destinations exist outside of mesquite and new routes in Mesquite would likely pass through Pleasant Grove, thus providing more coverage. Or maybe existing routes that turn away at a service boundary would just be extended further, providing more utility for riders of existing routes. This would be funded with money DART otherwise wouldn't have so we aren't taking anything away to do it. \n\nNow if we wanna give Mesquite a  2 billion dollar LRT extension that costs $10 million per year to operate and they only pay $40 million and we also have to provide bus and GoLink... Now your argument makes sense and I can see where you're coming from. But we don't have to hamstring DART's operational budget by funding new capital spending :)\n\n(These numbers were made up for examples btw, don't have any of these numbers or cost estimates)",

        "selftext": "I found the ridership data. All the ridership data for DARTZoom. Now im going to dump interesting information I found. For the first post, gonna start with some bad news\n\nI noticed that there was a decline in bus ridership since the pandemic (duh)\n\nBut, where this decline is the most noticeable is in the express bus\n\nColumns are as follows: route type, weekday ridership, saturday, sunday, ridership total for the quarter,  and riders per hour.\n\nExpress bus Data Q3 2019\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ndlwcr9yhpca1.png?width=1223&format=png&auto=webp&s=9696262afc84fe7c632ce5ec8a69690ad476288d\n\nExpress bus ridership Q3 2022\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ygkvmm93ipca1.png?width=1101&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fe88a403800d40dac87af3f66e6b96dd5db0d5e\n\nYIKES. That is a big casualty. (FYI 208 = 308,, 278 = 378, etc. They went up 1000)The Legacy west plano express went from 1,002 daily riders to having 354 daily riders. I suspect some of this has recovered since Q3 but yeah, downtown as a destination has really declined.\n\nNow, one thing to note is many of these express bus routes now have local variants that are doing pretty well. Particularly, the roue 239 which also goes down the Dallas North Tollway is doing really well, seeing 1,107 riders per weekday despite the low frequency.  If after a few more years the express ridership doesn't recover, then maybe they should be fully replaced with local variants.",

        "selftext": "This post is inspired by a certain council member from Dallas who only posts negative news about DART and public transportation. I wanted to highlight some of the good things happening with transit here in the DART service area. I also believe that DART doesn't always do a good job communicating their plans, but I watch their meetings and I know theres a lot they want to do and are trying to do that will really benefit all riders.\n\n1. Improved frequency. In 2022, DART launched a new bus network, but was unable to staff it properly. As a result, they were forced to [temporarily reduce service](https://www.reddit.com/r/dart/comments/uvcaa4/temporary_reduction_in_bus_service_coming/). On January 23rd, service will return to what its supposed to be [as frequency is restored](https://www.reddit.com/r/dart/comments/107y4rk/service_changes_coming_january_23rd_to_fixed/)\n2. GoLink is getting expanded hours. Soon, GoLink will operate 7 days a week between 5 am and 12 am.\n3. [New limited stop express bus routes](https://www.reddit.com/r/dart/comments/y6y9ij/potential_new_express_corridors/) are being planned\n4. Frequency enhancements are being planned on [at least 9 bus routes](https://www.reddit.com/r/dart/comments/106crgf/every_route_planned_to_potentially_get_more/)\n5. [Midday frequencies are being planned system wide](https://www.reddit.com/r/dart/comments/y7cio6/potential_frequency_improvements_update/), Light Rail included (this may or may not happen but they are looking into it)\n6. A pilot program launching soon to connect homeless on the system to resources\n7. [New bus shelters and benches being placed](https://www.reddit.com/r/dart/comments/ucikwe/new_bus_stop_amenity_upgrades_being_discussed/)\n8. DART hired more bus operators during their bus operator shortage and made bus service more reliable. 7% of bus trips were being missed as buses where ghosting passengers. but that problem is mostly over and very few trips are missed. On some days, 0 trips are missed across the whole system.\n9. Hiring more police\n10. Working on argeements with member cities to immediately increase police presence on system\n11. Provide elevator attendants to keep the elevators safe and clean, and to prevent people from living in the elevators and making them unusable\n12. Replacing the cloth seats with vinyl which are easier to keep clean\n13. Put 4G Modems in trains for better tracking (DO THIS FOR BUSES TOO PLEASE)\n14. Do a looot more cleanings in general\n15. Bus corridor improvements, taking the core frequent routes and spending money to improve bus stops, and to speed up buses through signal improvements, ways for buses to skip ahead of traffic, and even possibly bus lanes. At the very least, expect transit signal priority\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/epsqetm215ba1.png?width=1079&format=png&auto=webp&s=927b50245f62289cff7c1b2d3ee3caea34e37566\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3nna3iu115ba1.png?width=1128&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b42ef71b786610f4491a552d16f44802a7ccfc1\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6x7sc3mz05ba1.png?width=995&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa8fa4f4a042e0312bd1e82008fb727d6f6bf6ad\n\nSo yeah, you can expect more frequent buses, faster buses, more reliable buses, possibly some increased frequency on the light rail (which would require frequency boosts system wide for transfers to line up), increased security on the light rail, decreased crime on DART, cleaner DART, and more.\n\nI get so tired of this council person only ever saying negative things about DART, and the news coverage is also 90% negative. More than half of this information you'll never see in the news, yet as soon as there's a crime that happens on a train Dallas Morning News is talking about it. DART doesn't do the best job of showing you what I've shown here today. Nadine Lee is an awesome CEO and I believe we have an amazing board right now, and staff does a great job presenting this information at the meetings I do watch. There are transit experts out there trying so hard to make this work and I feel like we don't often appreciate it.  \n",

Visitors, occasional users, and newcomers to transit are much more likely to use third-party navigation apps like Google Maps to plan their transit trips than figure out that the only way to access real-time information is through a transit agency specific app: GoPass. DART rightfully wants lots of eyeballs on GoPass, but it can build that customer base by getting customers used to using GoPass to pay their fares. Then, folks may discover and choose to use (or not) the bus/train real time feature in GoPass. But for Pete\u2019s sake, make it as easy as possible for people to access the DART system by sharing accurate information about bus/rail vehicle locations and ETAs widely across multiple platforms that people use to plan their travel. I\u2019ve heard that a bus system expert with whom DART has much experience recommended that DART open up its data feed, and was rebuffed by the folks who favor building closed systems over empowering the public with accurate information and optimizing the traveler experience.",

DART had lost these employees because in the past their pay wasn't competitive but they increased police pay. \n\nSo theres another plan to work out some agreements to increase police presence through help from the service area city police departments.

If you avoid the lane the bus is in anyways then on elm and commerce where there's constantly tons of buses, that lane might as well be a bus lane for ya. You avoid it anyways.\n\nI'll make the case for bus lanes here but keep in mind they are not appropriate all the time. So the roads you're thinking of where you avoid the lane the bus is traveling may not even be a good candidate for bus lanes in the first place.\n\nThere's something called the Downs Thompson paradox, and one thing it states is that the time it takes to get somewhere is upperbounded by the time it takes to get there by transit. When public transportation is the fastest way to get somewhere, people are rational, and will switch to using the transit. This keeps happening until some sort of equilibrium is reached and the driving time catches up to the transit time. You'd be surprised how competitive driving is with transit time in cities like Hong Kong because the default assumption is that transit is just better in places like that. The travel times are similar and it's due to the Downs Thompson paradox.\n\nDART isn't very comprehensive right now so it's not faster than driving except for a few situations like traveling from Garland or maybe during peak rush hour. So we don't get these benefits, but bus lanes are very cheap to implement and could speed up transit travel times significantly. The reason for this is, take a look at the red line. Travels along 75 into downtown. Problem is, not everyone using 75 is going to downtown. Some are going for 635 or Loop 12. Since the transit travel times are low to areas along those corridors, DART isn't going to capture any of that travel demand (maybe some for loop 12)\n\nNot only that but a bus lane could save your life. Emergency vehicles will use them too. This happens all the time in cities with bus lanes. \n\n\nAgain it's just one tool for the job. There's still transit signal priority, which I don't think you're against but correct me if I'm wrong",

On the opposite end of the extreme, the 883 bus route has a subsidy per passenger of something like $1.70 or somewhere around there. Serving the over 5000 daily riders of the 883 with golink would be astronomically expensive.  \n\n\nI also think GoLink is superior to Via. Golink in Rowlette lets you go anywhere in Rowlette, or it can connect you to the light rail system at Rowlette station. Via at Arlington keeps you trapped in Arlington. The connections to other transit are piss poor, and its not a good system.\n\n  \nYou need a mixed approach. In Garland it makes sense to do fixed route. In Oak cliff, it makes sense to do fixed route. In Plano, it makes a little more sense to do go link but still have a few fixed routes and express routes for your areas of high ridership demand. GoLink and Via are low capacity systems and can easily be overwhelemed. There are pros and cons, and theres no one sized fits all solution.",

Obviously it can be done, [there's posts about DART bar hopping as far back as 9 yrs ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dallas/comments/1vuq0o/the_dart_rail_bar_hopping/), but it got me thinking of where'd I go on each stop. I'll make a separate post for each line over time. First up, Red Line.\n\nThese are places I would enjoy going to, they may not be the best one. Some of these places I haven't been to or its been years.\n\nMy criteria for the bar crawl was\n\n* Assuming you're traveling from the furthest north location and working south for each line. (Or furthest west to east)\n* Within 2-4 miles of the station. Let me know if its not easy to walk from the station to the location, we all know how not pedestrian friendly some places are\n\nThis is all hypothetical, drink safely yall.\n\n**Red Line:**\n\nStart at Downtown Plano Station, hit up [Vickery Park](https://goo.gl/maps/rdxCBRtt4nPwPt9Y7) first for a great beer selection and above average bar food to fuel you up. Maybe [Urban Crust](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Urban+Crust/@33.0195688,-96.7002517,20z/data=!3m1!5s0x864c191b99e9a101:0x65ff0aa9191887ea!4m5!3m4!1s0x864c191b9757bc17:0xe46bd617e8b59d28!8m2!3d33.0194339!4d-96.700204)/[32 Degree Rooftop Bar](https://goo.gl/maps/JQPduwLdxsEAx1QA7) for the roof top bar.\n\nAt City Line Station we're hopping off for either [The Brass Tap](https://goo.gl/maps/HACUPtFDB1AZH9Se7) or [Fernando's](https://goo.gl/maps/1oTzsvdp1pMobDtJ6).\n\nRest until Park Lane Station, go to [Bowl & Barrel](https://goo.gl/maps/7YZ5a7XS1uWiH1w86) for the vibes and an espresso martini. Maybe grab a little pizza at [Grimaldi's Pizzeria](https://goo.gl/maps/tzCehZza2NH2wtt77), catch up on some water intake.\n\nRest more, stop off at Mockingbird Station for [People's Last Stand](https://goo.gl/maps/9PitNJmicYFHDDdp6). Great vibes, great cocktails.\n\nAt City Place/Uptown Station, take a trip to [The Loon](https://goo.gl/maps/H4T3iEZk9Lg7YQFo9). Great places to reflect on your life choices. Moving on.\n\nAs you're looking out the window, see if you can spot where the forgotten Knox\u2013Henderson station was supposed to be.\n\nPearl/Arts District-West End Stations I'm just going to list out my options here: [Crafty Irishman](https://goo.gl/maps/rxBzCG6gL6rDqw859), [City Tavern](https://goo.gl/maps/aCxmM2S3S3KmukcQ8), [Frankie's](https://goo.gl/maps/h4mLX6xmPQzjbb347), [3Eleven Kitchen and Cocktails](https://goo.gl/maps/Vb4NdDNPmocuBfoz8)\n\nI would stop my journey at The Cedars Station and go to [Lee Harvey's](https://goo.gl/maps/wKj8z9Jn7oPREf9s7).",

Otherwise, you could catch a streetcar headed the opposite way to return to Cityplace/Uptown.

We didn't know what exactly was coming, I just predicted that routes 239 and 241 would get frequency improvements. We don't know when they are coming, but DART has released a draft of their phase 2 plans.   \n\n\nDART posted this map recently, but didn't list out which routes are being improved. I went in and found every single route that is being improved.  \n\n\n  \nTHIS IS A DRAFT. JUST A DRAFT. THINGS CAN CHANGE!!!! Now with that in mind ---\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ma0j6vpvkraa1.png?width=751&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e49de1ceeef68f557f8d39fc459f6c6d89a1301\n\n  \nSo what I've gathered:  \n\n\nGreen = 200 series, AKA Local series (40-60 minutes headways off peak. Dark green is 40 minutes off peak)  \nblue = 100 series (30 minutes Headways off peak)  \nPurple = double digit AKA core frequent series (20 minute headways off peak)  \nred = 15 minute hedaways all day. I'll call these the ultra frequents  \n\n\nHere are the routes that got improved. I may have missed a few, but I THINK I got all of them  \n\n\nLocal promotions:\n\n* [Route 200](https://dartorgcmsblob.dart.org/prod/docs/default-source/marketing/busroutes/200map.pdf?t=638087367015994532) (Downtown Garland, to Richardson Spring Valley Station) promotion to core frequent\n* [Route 218](https://dartorgcmsblob.dart.org/prod/docs/default-source/marketing/busroutes/218map.pdf?t=638087354110699553) (Lawn View - Lake June Via Military Parkway and Burton) promotion to core frequent\n* [Route 229](https://dartorgcmsblob.dart.org/prod/docs/default-source/marketing/busroutes/229map.pdf?t=638087368620509919) (Downtown Irving  - Las Colinas - Downtown Carrolton - Addison) promotion to core frequent Route 230 (Runs from airport area through Irving Boulevard to Downtown Dallas) promotion to core frequent\n* [Route 239](https://dartorgcmsblob.dart.org/prod/docs/default-source/marketing/busroutes/239map.pdf?t=638087369011990738) (Legacy Plano - Addison - Downtown Dallas) promotion to core frequent\n* [Route 241](https://dartorgcmsblob.dart.org/prod/docs/default-source/marketing/busroutes/241map.pdf?t=638087369306799275) (legacy plano - Coit - Forest Lane Station) promotion to 100 series\n\n100 Series promotions:  \n\n\n* [Route 101](https://dartorgcmsblob.dart.org/prod/docs/default-source/marketing/busroutes/101map.pdf?t=638087355568507481) (South Oak Cliff - Hampton Station- Medical District) Promotion to core frequent\n* [Route 104](https://dartorgcmsblob.dart.org/prod/docs/default-source/marketing/busroutes/104map.pdf?t=638087356903615778) (Mountain View College - Westmoreland - MLK Jr. Station) Promotion to core frequent\n\nCore Frequent Promotions:\n\n* [Route 23](https://dartorgcmsblob.dart.org/prod/docs/default-source/marketing/busroutes/23map.pdf?t=638087358678786928) (Parkland - Cityplace - Fair Park - MLK Jr Station) promotion to Ultra Frequent \n* [Route 13](https://dartorgcmsblob.dart.org/prod/docs/default-source/marketing/busroutes/13map.pdf?t=638087360366654827) (West Transfer Center - Malcom X Transfer Location - Hatcher - J.B.

I'm not 100% sure, if you find one let me know so I can edit this post.  \n\n\n  \nThese are some really good suburban improvements and southern sector improvements. I'm impressed. These are all routes I knew were performing really well, but I don't have the best idea on how well each route is performing so this can be thought of as confirmation.\n\nOh and I mentioned rail in the title didn't I?  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4gk83l4tpraa1.png?width=1111&format=png&auto=webp&s=790bd0c8edf7f17fb8a5fed63959de1d3465ed33\n\nThats right, midday frequency on rail and core frequent bus routes adjusted to 15 minutes. The locals also need to come every 30 midday instead of 40 for transfers to line up. Exciting stuff. Seems like DART is presenting all of this and more to the public in a month or two.",

The grid network shown here would have 15 minute peak frequencies, and 30 minute off peak frequencies, and that costs DART an additional  $72 million.  \n\n\nThe fact that this is even possible, for only $72 million extra is astounding to me (although that wont get us as far anymore with inflation). \n\nBut this network is far from perfect, that 30 minutes off peak frequency would mean a net decline in frequency for a lot of routes with better off peak service. There are many high performing routes that take a turn that are missing from here (First one that comes to mind for me is the route 22). Not every route should conform to the grid, its okay to have turns and sometimes even deviations. Transferring off 30 minutes off peak might be a pain in the ass too, if the frequency is 30 minutes I can see why some may prefer a timed transfer at a transit center like we have now.   \n\n\nThere's a few areas of really low ridership demand that have comically high levels of service. The main one being far north Plano, near the northern end of the service boundary. Bus service just does not do well here, the residents are wealthy, the neighborhoods are sprawling, and even frequent transit probably wouldn't get much use here. If you notice, there's no east west routes in Highland Park. That is because east west bus routes have performed horribly there.   \n\n\nYou may also notice the lack of east-west in East Dallas/uptown area. DART looked into it, but service planning says its extremely difficult because most of the roads that are good candidates for bus service just go to Downtown Dallas. The problem is, the east-west roads arent very long, would require lots of small turns, and go through really narrow roads that would take forever to navigate.  \n\n\nPleasant grove and oak cliff are also disconnected, because there's no good roads to connect them.\n\nThis network is not perfect, but its useful to see what we can do with just a little bit more funding. DART received about $610 million in sales tax revenue last year. This is a really comprehensive network that would make a lot of trips way easier. It honestly gets me excited for DARTZoom 2.0, I have no idea how much more money will be budget towards the bus network for 2.0, but I'm hoping its a good amount!",

This encompasses two stations: Kiest Station and VA Medical Center Station.\n\n**Among grade-separated solutions...**\n\nElevation wins in cost-efficiency\n\n1. **Elevated**: requires rebuild of 3 miles of track, rebuild 2 stations, and elevators\n2. **Trenched:** requires same as elevated plus pump stations for flood control. Small chance of needing to acquire mineral rights.\n3. **Tunnel:** requires same as trenched but bigger pumps plus interference with underground utilities (water and sewage). Higher chance of needing to acquire mineral rights.\n\nTunnel wins in footprint\n\n1. **Tunnel:** requires minimal surface land. A budget implementation can have station portal on just one side of road instead of both.\n2. **Trenched:** some additional width for elevator shafts, limits pedestrian ability to cross on foot, bridges required for intersections.\n3. **Elevated**: large pylons on either side of the road for each of the two elevated station.\n\n**A mixed separated & at-grade solution...**\n\nHere's what I suggest minimizing cost and footprint, as well as minimize disruptions to transit riders. Starting from Illinois Station and moving south:\n\n1. **Elevate track between Illinois Ave and Kiest Station.** Track is already elevated over Illinois, so this just continues that.\n2. **Move Kiest Station out of the road and elevated over parking lot** of Family Dollar and DD's Discount; they definitely don't need all that parking. This minimizes construction overtop the road.\n3. Ground track south of Kiest.\n4. **Elevate Ann Arbor Ave over Lancaster Rd.** It is possible ramps can be left out if traffic that would have turned can just as easily detour. Even if junction still necessary, it can be entirely on the west side of track. Either way, this eliminates conflict at this intersection.\n5. **Shift VA Station so that all car lanes are on west side of station and station is as close to facility as possible.** It already sucks that anyone deboarding train here to go to VA hospital still has to walk across several lanes of traffic. Putting the station as close to the facility as possible, claiming parking lot space, if necessary, makes access to the hospital as safe and easy as possible by train. Considering this is a veteran's hospital, it'll also be far more convenient for elderly passengers and wheelchair bound users to de-board at-grade, rather than navigate stairs and (often broken) elevators.\n6. **Elevate Loop 12 over Lancaster Rd.** Same logic as elevating Ann Arbor Ave.\n\nWhen entertaining infrastructure improvements to rail network, one principal I suggest is thinking outside of the box and considering not just how to modify the rail but also how to modify the road. An inherent advantage of modifying the road instead of the rail is that car users can easily detour during disruption; rail users have very limited detour options.\n\nIt also helps to consider whether sources of conflict are even necessary. For example, do we *need* to allow for turning at Ann Arbor Ave? It's not a major artery, probably doesn't hurt to just let drivers filter somewhere else and save the infrastructure expense.",

        "selftext": "Recently, on various discord servers and posts on this sub, I've noticed there's a lot of discussion and dreaming about potential expansions to the rail system. In this post I'm going to explain why that may not always be the best idea.  \n\n\nFirst, its important to recognize that DART is one of the worst financial performers in the transit world. This is of course bad, systems with a higher farebox recovery ratio (money they get back from fares) tend to be better. We also have a rail system that, off peak, runs every 20-30 minutes, which is not super great. Ridership is not great in many parts of the system, while the north east corridors tend to do well and the greenline stations do okay, much of the orange line stations and the blue/red line stations south of downtown are not good performers. That is to say, DART spent a lot of money to serve not a lot of people.  \n\n\nThe silver line is another good example of this. A nearly $2 billion dollar project for a projected day one ridership of 5,000 passengers per day. Service that ends at 9 pm, and hourly off peak service. A lot of money is being invested in a project that will not capture a lot of ridership.  \n\n\nFor reference, the 883 West, one of the shortest bus routes in the DART system, carries over 5,000 riders per day. The Silver line, which costs $2 billion, will serve about as many riders day one. This is not only an inefficient use of money, but I'd take it a step further and say this kind of spending holds DART back.  \n\n\nHow does the rail system hold DART back? Take a look at this screenshot from the 2045 transit system plan. As you can see, much of DART's budget is going towards paying towards debt service that was used for all this capital spending. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sdsc0zfr6y6a1.png?width=1006&format=png&auto=webp&s=990d507165ff45b5190122f0ba6b4165d12f6edb\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe good news is, starting in 2034/2035, a lot of the debt used to pay for all this expansion is paid off and DART will have more money to spend. Now the question is, would you rather DART spend these freed up funds on a light rail extension to McKinney, or would you rather see DART spend this on improving the system they already have? Would spending an estimated $5 billion (DART's estimate not mine) on a DNT rail corridor be worth it when we could probably spend that money on some kickass bus network improvements instead?\n\n  \nIf you must create fantasy map, that is fine, but use this map as a guide. Draw new lines that make connections to existing transit (transit centers, rail lines) and lines that connect places of density. Do that and you'll end up with a  way better fantasy map than ones that have a Downtown Irving to Legacy Plano line.  Do this instead of chasing that tempting sprawl.   \n\n\n[A DNT style corridor actually could hit some of this density](https://preview.redd.it/ln8g6rs35y6a1.png?width=675&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa481b68070accf9f65ee03ff4b2a3382b7b8a45)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not saying DART should never expand, but any rail expansion worth doing is probably going to be extremely expensive and go through areas DART does NOT have the right of way for. This may or may not be a good idea, but consider what that money can be used for first. ***If the project is cheap, its probably NOT worth doing.*** \n\nOf course if some magic pot of federal/state money appears to fund some good rail expansion, DART should take advantage. But until then, focus on service.",

Ride quality\n2. higher capacity\n\nWhen you run a lot of buses, you run into this problem called bus bunching, where your headways are so tight buses often end up bunching together and you just have a series of 2-3 buses serving the same route right behind each other because the bus infront was delayed.

When DART extended their rail lines, a lot of ridreship just shifted to the new terminus. They added a lot of miles, but didnt get a lot of new riders for the miles they were adding. Really their metrics wouldn't be too bad if the rail lines were shorter and the orange line didnt exist. Some extentions, like the blue line to UNT dallas, you can maybe justify on \"well lets get to this university ahead of its growth and encourage economic development there\" or whatever, but the UNT Dallas extension didnt grow ridership (and thats just one of many examples, though one day I hope it does grow ridership)  \n\n\nYou are right about streetcars encouraging development, they are very good at that and we see that with the oak cliff line.    \n\n\nI think the routes 1/3/9 are awesome and can already achieve what your asking for (they serve the center city well).   \n\n\nTou've changed my mind a little bit though. I don't think streetcars are necessarily a bad idea, but if they go with them I think they should be upgraded to LRT standards, and DART should focus on other items first. I think theres other more important investments and low hanging fruit that need to be worked on before we do streetcars which to me still feel like a nice to have. And some of those low hanging fruite are streetcar related.  \n\n\nI'd like to see them upgrade frequency on their most used bus routes, improve on time performance on their most used routes (or their most late ones) by using signal priority, and I'd like to see seating at more/most bus stops. I'd like to see something done to improve bus traffic on elm/commerce (probably bus lanes, if anywhere in the service area justifies bus lanes its elm/commerce), and D2.   \n\n\nAnd i  believe that, before DART adds more streetcars they have to run their existing streetcars correctly. Modernize the M-line, build central link, run better headways on your street cars (m-line in particular, but I think after central link the oak cliff streetcar will have the ridership demand for more headways, or higher headways will create that ridership demand). Oh and if one of the main reasons for doing this is to help with economic development, we have to pre-empt the nimbys. This is something DART should have done with its LRT before building it. DART should require Dallas to change the zoning for walkable/mixed use and density before giving them streetcar. This tactic SHOULD have been done with the LRT as well. Board member Patrick Kennedy has tried to get this kind of requirement in the ILA for the D2 subway, requiring Dallas to upzone around DART stations if DART builds D2, but Dallas keeps removing that language from the agreement.   \n\n\nNadine Lee, current CEO, has stated multiple times in different interviews that she wants DART to focus on improving the experience for existing customers rather than trying to appeal to new ones. She wants to fight the ridership decline, and in doing so DART will probably attract new riders. And to me, as a rider, a streetcar feels like a nice to have. but having my bus transfer line up more reliably with the light rail arrival? Now that would be awesome. Having more frequent service on overcrowding routes like the 239/241? Amazing. Using a street car instead of the route 9.. Thats neat but not necessary, I just like that the route 9 comes often. If it does lead to dense development that would be pretty awesome though, but theres other improvements I want to see more/first.",

(Ex: travel to/from the state fair - if you don't get on the train near downtown during the fair good luck even getting on. Also - good luck getting on it to leave the fair. Got a stroller? Good luck getting on.)\n\nThat's problem one.\n\nProblem two is reputation. DART needs to do a serious reputation management campaign. People in the direction of the airport are all worried that ever train brings a carload of drug dealers and burglars, and they wouldn't dare rub crowded elbows with \"those people\". Never mind that \"those people\" can drive a car, they're somehow magically kept in Dallas as long as there are as few trains as possible. People have fought tooth and nail to keep rail out of the middle of DFW as much as possible.\n\nPersonally riding the TRE and hopping on the DART is awesome until I need to get somewhere that's not on the DART line. Which is most places. So I rarely ride.",

Thats not to say the rail system should never expand but we really need to look at what the money can be used for instead.",

Not realistic \n\n\nHigh speed rail takes time to accelerate and these cities are all too close. Just make the TRE faster (which can be done with more double and triple tracking, and even electrification). Maybe even run a TRE express train that skips some stops (which you can do with more double/triple tracking)",

And Dallas-Houston has been in development hell, looking worse every year, especially since we've heard crickets after the CEO jumped ship in the middle of this year.\n\nStill, an environmental study never hurt anyone. Guess we'll see what they have in mind. I do agree that there's little chance this would be particularly useful by itself, though, and the money would be better served on the TRE / last-mile for now.",

        "selftext": "Recently, user u/nihouma told me about this cross town express route that went down 635. At the time, the route number was 234 (back then, DART express bus route #'s were in the 200 range)\n\nThis bus route went down 635 to connect Forest Lane Station to Las Colinas. So what happened?\n\nWell, apparently there was a lot of delays and construction on 635 that made the route prone to delays and basically useless. DART re-routed the express bus to go down Royal Lane (from Forest Lane to Las Colinas) but by that point the ridership that was slowly growing had tanked and DART had to cut the route due to a lack of ridership.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/19dqe1wdxe0a1.png?width=810&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2a347df8b54cab4d9037950e44971f78b23f412\n\nIts a real shame, because speedy cross town service is really lacking and this is such an interesting route. Every express route we have today serves downtown, so its cool to see one that serves a different location.\n\nHowever, the Las Colinas cross town express may make a comeback, as well as other express new express routes.\n\nI made a post about this earlier, but DART is looking into various express bus corridors. Here are some they have considered:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c10exyfzxe0a1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0f2d356e0db89dd5ac64dd845ad0768e36e23b9\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo yes, we have a much longer 635 corridor being considered, as well as some other interesting express options.\n\nHistorically, 635 express has been something DART planners have been considering for years.\n\nFrom the 1989 transit system plan:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s7xwvdn8ye0a1.png?width=667&format=png&auto=webp&s=29b0f473e5eb94ae03eeac62f018c7062a28418a\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd from the 2006 Transit system plan:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7qtt5mkeye0a1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=f15dba3b1852415109498e70d63c91944ceb1aff\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would love to see more cross town faster/express bus routes, so as apart of phase 2 of DartZoom, lets hope we see more of these! I really think the Las Colinas cross town route suffered from bad timing, and in the future it may do very well",

We don't hit the center of our medical district, we don't hit love field directly, north Park Mall requires a shuttle bus. We don't hit the jobs on LBJ/central well, and some stations (like lovers lane) are right next to freeways and have limited walk shed.\n\nAt the same time though, the right of way the red line was built on is very clearly successful. Pre pandemic the north parts of both the red and blue lines are pretty successful. Infact, an article Patrick Kennedy wrote on Dmagazine claimed that if DART we're just downtown Dallas to Plano and downtown Dallas to Rowlette (North east blue/red lines), it would nearly be profitable.\n\nBut there's certain sections they should have deviated from their right of way a bit. And yes this would add costs, but that really just means it would have taken longer to build. And if we had that transit system today, I think ridership would be way higher.\n\n\nAt the same time though, some areas really just are better served by park and ride buses. The orange line in Irving is a good example, ridership at most of those stations is really low. DART spent a lot of money extending their rail, and some rail extensions added lots of ridership (Garland -> Rowlette is actually a surprising example of this) but most rail extensions really just shifted ridership. The end of line stations always do well, but when you extend, everyone just parks and rides at the next end of line station. \n\nI think DART should have taken a more Houston style approach personally, but extending into Rowlette and Plano was clearly a winner. Carrolton/Farmer's Branch not as much, and orange line in Irving is struggling (and probably tanks our ridership per mile average pretty substantially)\n\nI don't mind that our rail system is 93 miles, but, they should have taken the extra time/money to make it the right 93 miles. Even if that meant the build out took 5-10 years longer to get where we are today, I think that patience and focus on hitting good density would have really helped out. \n\nI find areas like Uptown, Preston, Addison and east Dallas would probably provide amazing ridership yet the silver line, the next big project DART is currently working on, doesn't hit these areas. With the Houston approach, I feel like the priority would be hitting those areas. \n\nSo overall I much prefer Houston's approach to rail and serving suburbs with express bus.\n\nThat said, Houston, your trains should really run on elevated ROW",

Metro only serves the city of Houston (and maybe a couple other cities?) so the push to build rail out wasn\u2019t needed by them. DART on the other hand needed to make its taxpayers happy and get its rail built to serve them as soon as possible. Otherwise, the city would just leave DART. Several cities did leave DART. Flower Mound comes to mind.\nOverall I\u2019m glad DART rail services the airports, even though it\u2019s slow. I lived in Houston but was out in the southeastern subburbs and dreamed to be able to be near a useful rail station. My mother use to commute on the many express buses though from out there. Those buses that used the HOV lanes had pretty high ridership.\n\nAll in all, DART needs the density around all of its stations. I think this is more of a failure of cities to get development going. The northern Green Line is literally just parking lots. I know Trinity Mills just broke ground on something. But every single station needs to be made a destination now. Houston already has this for its rail.",

The M line has great ridership and is in large part due to it being a great neighborhood circulator. If the city dedicated resources to making it have better stops and giving it a dedicated right of way, it would be even better. If the city connected the Dallas Streetcar to it, that's then allows (theoretically) Dallas Streetcar to service uptown as well improving Dallas Streetcar ridership, and potentially (hopefully) creating the political will tlfor City of Dallas to invest in expansions in Old East Dallas to Baylor, the Medical District, Love Field, Oak Lawn,southern downtown, the Cedars, and Trinity Groves.",

I already made a post about the cost of increasing the light rail frequency, it's actually kinda cheap. The real killer is increasing the frequency of all connecting buses, which is also... Kind of cheap as it turns out. $30 million per year. Local 200 routes need to run every 30 minutes off peak so that the connecting bus arrives at the same time as the frequent bus/train.\n\n\nI'm glad we finally have this cost though, the real cost of running peak frequency off peak.
